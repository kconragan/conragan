This morning, while drinking my coffee, I put on [Jack Van Cleaf’s new song (featuring Zach Bryan), "Rattlesnake"](https://song.link/i/1790934903)—I hadn't heard it before. A beautiful song. But one line, in particular, stayed with me: "Drunk on freedom, stuck on choice."

The night before, I watched [Perfect Days](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27503384/), a contemplative film by [Wim Wenders](https://g.co/kgs/jgm85kT) that gently pulls you into the life of Hirayama, a toilet cleaner in Japan. Hirayama lives an extreme routine. His days are structured, predictable, and seemingly limited. Yet, within these self-imposed constraints, he finds a profound sense of peace and even a unique kind of freedom. He is, in a word, happy. Or at least content. But he is anything but _drunk on choice_.

The film reminded me of another saying, one I read in [Naval Ravikant's almanac](https://www.navalmanack.com/): "Peace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion." Hirayama seems to have found that resting peace within his routine.

Hirayama's life explores the fine line _between_ contentment _and_ compromise. He has accepted a life of routine, finding joy and even freedom within its confines. But is this acceptance a conscious choice—a way of finding peace amidst the chaos of endless possibilities? Or is it a form of acquiescence, a quiet surrender to a limited existence?

It's a question I keep returning to: While focusing on what we _can_ control brings a sense of peace and harmony, the human spirit is inherently restless, forever questioning what _lies just beyond_ our control. Where is the balance point between accepting what is and exploring what can be?

So much of modern life is about shouldering the burden of limitless possibilities. We crave freedom, and in many ways, it has never been greater. Yet the sheer volume of choice available to us can be paralyzing. In [_The Paradox of Choice_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-paradox-of-choice-why-more-is-less-barry-schwartz/6437568), Barry Schwartz discusses how this abundance of choices increases the likelihood of regret.

Hirayama’s life can certainly be interpreted as an antidote to the paradox of choice. By limiting his options, he escapes the constant pressure to optimize or challenge the constraints of his life. He’s found peace in motion—a happiness born of purposeful action within a defined space, yet also, perhaps, tinged with a sense of something lost.

But what’s fascinating about _Perfect Days_ is how it subtly hints at the lived regret in Hirayama’s life. Later stages of the movie hint at pain from his past. And you are left wondering how much of Hirayama’s current life is about the avoidance of the vulnerability and potential pain that come with a deeper _emotional_ connection. Is Hirayama's routine a form of self-preservation, an attempt to avoid the hurt he once experienced? Or is it a hard-won acceptance of life's inherent limitations, a conscious choice to find joy in the present moment?

But the truth, as it so often does, becomes more complex. It's not simply a matter of self-preservation _or_ acceptance. It's the constant, internal negotiation between contentment and the yearning for something _more_, between finding peace in the present and striving for an unknown future—a dance between what is and what _could_ be.
