_I travel not to go anywhere, but to go_. This is mostly a collection of pictures from travels I did from 2006-2008 through SouthEast Asia. Indonesia. Malaysia. Singapore. China. Tibet. As photographers we tend to obsess on equipment, but these photos still stand up to my scrutiny over a decade later and they were taken on point-and-shoot cameras: Canon Powershot S-80 and Canon Powershot G2.
