Bird & Wildlife photography is a relatively new interest for me, but combines two other genres of photography I've long pursued: landscapes and sports. I see the opportunity to shoot wildlife in natural habitats as an extension of being outdoors. And birds and widlife aspect introduces a need to capture subjects in motion, something I started in my earliest days of photography when I did outdoor sports like surfing, mountain biking, snowboarding, equestrian, and more.
