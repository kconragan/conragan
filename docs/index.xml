      <description>The Orton Effect is an extremely popular (some might say overused) technique that imbues images with a soft, ethereal glow and touch of blur to add a painterly quality to photographs. Used with restraint and on the right images, it is a wonderful effect for good reason.&#xA;This effect was initially accomplished in the darkroom, pioneered by photographer Michael Orton in the 1980s. The technique involves a multi-exposure film process: one image shot in focus and correctly exposed, another slightly out-of-focus and overexposed.</description>

      <description>Growing up in Half Moon Bay, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent an a lot of time near Pillar Point looking for waves because some of my favorite surf spots are in the area. More recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been returning here not just for waves, but for photos of the incredible sea life.&#xA;Pillar Point is a photographer&amp;rsquo;s paradise. It&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to leave empty-handed, whether you&amp;rsquo;re capturing the vibrant flashes of migrating songbirds or the patient stalking of a Marsh Owl amid the reeds.</description>

      <description>Since buying a place in Central Oregon, I&amp;rsquo;ve been growing more and more fascinated with the eastern desert. As someone who grew up on the California coast, it&amp;rsquo;s a foreign landscape, and environment. Deadly but beautiful.&#xA;During our first summer in Oregon, my brother and sister-in-law recommended us a book titled, aptly, The Oregon Desert</description>

      <title>A photography road trip through the Eastern Sierras</title>

      <description>The Eastern Sierras have long captivated me. Growing up along the California coast, for many years my trips to the Sierras were in the western range out of sheer practicality. Getting to the Eastern Sierras is a commitment, especially in winter when the high passes close. But what awaits is a stunning landscape, far more rugged and, to my eyes, dramatic than the Western half. This is truly a geologic wonderland, with both the highest peak in the continental united states, less than 50 miles from one of the lowest places on the planet in Death Valley.</description>

      <description>Bird &amp;amp; wildlife photography combines my love for the outdoors with the excitement of capturing (at times) fast-paced action. A seamless blend of my early pursuits of both landscape and sports photography, these images represent an extension of both. Capturing the natural world allows me to immerse myself in the wonders of this place we call home.</description>
