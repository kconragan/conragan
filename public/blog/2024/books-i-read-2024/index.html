<p>Follows Tova Sullivan, an elderly cleaning woman at an aquarium who forms an unlikely bond with Marcellus, a giant Pacific octopus. Through their connection and Marcellus&rsquo;s remarkable intelligence, they unravel the mystery of Tova&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s disappearance thirty years earlier. This was a delightful book. (Think talking octopus!) I would read this book if you liked <em>House In The Cerulean Sea</em>. Both had a magical, whimsical quality while exploring the themes of love and loss, second chances, and the family you make.</p>

<p>Born from Brandon Sanderson&rsquo;s Secret Projects and inspired by a personal viewing of <em>The Princess Bride</em>, <em>Tress of the Emerald Sea</em> transports readers to a unique Cosmere world where oceans are made of deadly spores. This standalone novel follows Tress, a capable young woman who breaks from fairytale tradition to undertake a perilous journey to save her beloved, all under the witty and often meta commentary of Hoid&rsquo;s narration, ultimately delving into themes of courage, found family, and the subversion of traditional narrative tropes.</p>

<p>After reading <em>Tress</em> I was eager to try another of Brandon&rsquo;s Secret Projects. This one didn&rsquo;t captivate me as much, perhaps because the relentless action left less room for character development, but it was still an enjoyable, fast-paced read. The story follows Nomad (who we know is a character from another cosmere novel), constantly on the run from a seemingly unstoppable enemy. Landing on the latest planet in his flight, a world in a perpetual cycle of scorching sunrise and deadly freezing night, forcing its inhabitants to constantly migrate to survive. He doesn&rsquo;t want to be involved but is forced to help those on the planet he&rsquo;s landed on compelling an exploration of self-preservation vs. responsibility and the weight and cost of power.</p>

<p>I read <em>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</em> when it first came out. I had heard about <em>Piranesi</em> but didn&rsquo;t realize before I started it that it was by the same author. It tells the story of a man living a solitary existence in the House, a vast world of halls, statues, and tides. He meticulously documents his world, believing it to be the entirety of existence, only to slowly discover clues that hint at a much larger (and harsher) reality. I was struck by how the book explores the nature of reality and how our perception is shaped by the limits of our experience, while still finding beauty within those boundaries.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have picked up <em>The Great Alone</em> if my wife and I didn&rsquo;t share an Audible account, but I&rsquo;m so glad I did. Set in Alaska in the 1970s, it tells the story of the Allbright family, who move to the remote wilderness hoping for a fresh start, only to find that their personal demons have followed them. Thirteen-year-old Leni is caught in the middle of her parents&rsquo; increasingly volatile relationship, made even more intense by the isolation and harsh realities of Alaskan life. As the family struggles to survive against both the elements and the growing threat within their own home, Leni is forced to grow up fast and make some incredibly tough choices. Kristin Hannah does a beautiful job of capturing the raw beauty and power of the Alaskan wilderness; to me, it became the central character of the whole book. This one&rsquo;s definitely a heavier read, dealing with themes of survival, resilience, and the complexities of family bonds against a backdrop that&rsquo;s both beautiful and brutal, but it&rsquo;s a powerful story that stayed with me.</p>

<p>After finishing <em>The Great Alone</em>, I decided to give Kristin Hannah another go, and some Reddit sleuthing led me to <em>The Magic Hour</em>. Set in the small, rain-soaked town of Rain Valley in the Pacific Northwest, the story centers around a young, feral child who mysteriously appears one day, and a child psychologist, brought in to help, who makes it her mission to unravel the girl&rsquo;s past. While the setting plays a less dominant role here than in <em>The Great Alone</em>, I was captivated by the relationship that develops between the psychologist and the child. It&rsquo;s another beautiful story about found family and how, in serving others, we can find the way forward to forgive and heal ourselves. While it didn&rsquo;t quite reach the heights of <em>The Great Alone</em> for me, it was still a worthwhile read.</p>

<p>One of just a couple non-fiction books I read this year. But that’s OK. Even having worked in tech for 25 years, I learned somethings in this book. Johann Hari&rsquo;s shows how our attention spans aren&rsquo;t simply weakening, but are being actively <em>stolen</em> by powerful forces in modern society. From social media algorithms to the pressures of constant productivity, Hari explores the myriad ways our ability to concentrate is being eroded. One quote that really stuck with me perfectly summarizes why I read so much fiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Perhaps fiction is a kind of empathy gym, boosting your ability to empathize with other people—which is one of the most rich and precious forms of focus we have.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hari argues that developing this ability to focus is a crucial step in reclaiming our attention. I didn’t agree with all the premises, or conclusions. But the book was eye opening just how systemic of an issue our lost attention is and individual effort may not be enough to fully recover it. At the same time, this book did compel me to better manage my focus. I removed TikTok. Blocked most notifications on my phone. Installed an app that forced a pause before opening certain apps. And you know, it helps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I felt in that moment that we all have a choice now between two profound forces—fragmentation, or flow. Fragmentation makes you smaller, shallower, angrier. Flow makes you bigger, deeper, calmer. Fragmentation shrinks us. Flow expands us.</em></p>

<p>I’d read the first two books in this series already, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-shadow-of-the-gods-john-gwynne/18789990?ean=9780316497824"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Shadow Of The Gods</a></em> and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-hunger-of-the-gods-john-gwynne/17557579?ean=9780316497862"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hunger Of The Gods</a></em>, but the 3rd and final book, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-fury-of-the-gods-john-gwynne/20432457?ean=9780316497909"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fury Of The Gods</a></em>, was one of my most anticipated books this year. I reread the first two books and eagerly jumped into the final installment when it first came out. And it didn’t disappoint. One of the things I love about John’s writing is he doesn’t pull punches. People you root for don’t all make it. I felt the middle of the book wandered a bit more at times than it needed to, but boy does the ending wrap things up tidily. Orka is one of my favorite fantasy characters ever. Enough said. I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves Norse mythology, brutal action, and complex characters.</p>

<p><em>The Final Empire</em> was actually the first Brandon Sanderson book I read over a decade ago. I really enjoyed it and it propelled me into his other series including <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>. Yet, somehow I missed reading the final book in the original trilogy. So this year I read all three books of the Mistborn Saga, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/mistborn-the-final-empire-brandon-sanderson/19429636?ean=9780765377139"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Final Empire</a></em>, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-well-of-ascension-brandon-sanderson/7442377?ean=9780765316886"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Well Of Ascension</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-hero-of-ages-brandon-sanderson/7325993?ean=9780765316893"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hero Of Ages</a></em>, and read <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-alloy-of-law-a-mistborn-novel-brandon-sanderson/12028892?ean=9780765330424"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alloy Of Law</a></em> which takes place some 300 years after the original trilogy. These are fun books. They are easier to get through than <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> but still have an epic fantasy feel.</p>

<p>A couple years ago I suddenly found myself interested in birds. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@keitht999/video/7293697268018924843"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s crazy how fast it sneaks up on you</a>. I can’t really blame it on the pandemic as I didn’t get into it until 2023. Nevertheless, now I’ve got a whole photography section for birds and there is ample <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9623220/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research showing the mental health benefits</a>. Cooper shares the joys and solace he finds in birdwatching, while also frankly discussing the challenges and prejudices he&rsquo;s faced in the predominantly white world of birding, most notably detailed in his viral Central Park incident. This book offers a unique perspective on the healing power of nature, the importance of diversity in the outdoors, and the need to make these spaces more inclusive for everyone. It&rsquo;s a powerful reminder that the simple act of observing birds can be a profound source of connection, reflection, and even social change.</p>

<p>A story of revenge told in predictably violent but humorous way only Joe seems to manage. I love the cast of characters in this book: the poisoner Castor Morveer, the mercenary Nicomo Cosca, the Northman Caul Shivers. This is a standalone novel set in the world of Joe&rsquo;s First Law trilogy, but can absolutely be read on its own.</p>

<p>While waiting for the conclusion to <em>The Bloodsworn Trilogy</em>, I dove into John Gwynne&rsquo;s earlier series, <em>The Faithful and the Fallen</em> (four books in total: <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/malice-john-gwynne/7294494?ean=9780316259545"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malice</a></em>, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/valor-john-gwynne/1704659?ean=9780316259507"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valor</a></em>, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/ruin-john-gwynne/7836216?ean=9780316259576"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruin</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/wrath-john-gwynne/7836456?ean=9780316259606"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wrath</a></em>). Honestly, it didn&rsquo;t grip me quite as much as <em>Bloodsworn</em>. The plot meanders a bit, and some characters feel a little less developed. That said, it&rsquo;s still an enjoyable read, and the series wraps up nicely. It was also cool to see Gwynne&rsquo;s growth as a writer between series. My advice? Start with this one before <em>Bloodsworn</em>. They&rsquo;re not directly connected, but <em>Faithful and the Fallen</em> might feel like a step back in terms of writing and story if you read them in reverse.</p>

<p>Logen Ninefingers is one of my favorite fiction characters—of any genre—of all time. I read <em>The First Law</em> years ago but somehow never managed to finish the series. I took care of that this year by reading <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-blade-itself-joe-abercrombie/6552854?ean=9780316068789"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Blade Itself</a></em>, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/before-they-are-hanged-joe-abercrombie/18850858?ean=9780316068796"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Before They Are Hanged</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/last-argument-of-kings-joe-abercrombie/14599416?ean=9780316068772"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Argument Of Kings</a></em>. What I love about this series is almost every character is morally gray. There are few true heroes or villains. Most characters make choices based on self-interest, survival, or flawed ideals but are unapologetic (although remorseful) in doing so. But in the moral murk, the</p>
