When multiple interests intersect, I'm hooked. Case in point: the Yellowstone miniseries 
1923, which I'm a huge fan of (favorite offshoot, even more than core Yellowstone). I also love [photography](/photography/). And, uncovering behind-the-scenes commentary on a Reddit thread? Chefs kiss.

The beautiful photos accompanying this [Elle]() piece about the costume design by Janie Bryant for season 2 of 1923 were shot on a period-authentic Graflex Super D and the FP-100C peelapart film. The photography is by [Sarah Coulter](http://www.sarahkcoulter.com/) who is the Director of Photography for Paramount+ and Showtime.

Adding a layer of behind-the-scenes coolness, a [comment from a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1j7vks0/comment/mh6crv1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in the [r/photography](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/) subreddit revealed more details by someone who assisted Sarah and lent the camera used:

>Definitely my favorite combo to shoot with. Sarah is a friend of mine from NYC and brought me on to assist her to shoot on a (relatively) period accurate camera. It’s a 1940s 3.25x4.25” Graflex Super D I had modified to shot 4x5 film that is essentially identical to earlier models from the 20s. So I used a special centered 405 peelapart back and lots of that sweet sweet peelapart I sourced from a friend. We had to use an absolutely insane amount of tungsten lights on set as the film is roughly 80ASA and the lens is f4.5 wide open.
