### Notes
Second dive of the day. During our surface interval we were greeted to whales spouting just by the boat! My first time diving at Eric's Pinnacle. The visibility here was better than our first dive earlier in the day. Though the regulars said it gets up to 100' on the best days. Today we had perhaps 20'. Lots of schooling rockfish and beautiful topography along the North side of the pinnacle. I was definitely cold this dive, not having fully restored my core temperature from the first dive. And you can see it in my SCR which ticked up a bit. Very much looking forward to my dry suit course late this year.
