A fun little webpage that provides a live estimate of chances that [2024 YR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_YR4) asteroid makes contact with Earth. Today the chance is 1 in 279 (I've seen it go as high as 1 in 47).

I think [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/14/asteroid) summarizes this perfectly:

> It’s true, it is somehow comforting to contemplate the potential of the end of the world that at least isn’t my fault. It doesn’t make me feel like I’m complicit by not recycling a plastic bottle that one time or whatever. Like phew, I get to wallow in a guilt-free imminently immanentised eschaton.
