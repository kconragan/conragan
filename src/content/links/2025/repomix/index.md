Found via [Harper](https://harper.blog). A lovely little tool that takes your code repository and packages it into an AI-friendly file that you can use with your favorite codegen agent. There's a dead-simple web UI that you can just point your Github repository at. Or, you can install locally to use in your terminal with more options.
