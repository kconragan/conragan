A nice article on the latest developments to turn the SS United States into the world’s largest underwater reef in Florida. [Earlier this year I dived the U.S.S. Spiegel Grove and U.S.S. Vandenberg](/blog/2025/diving-florida-keys-2024/). Sizable ships in their own right. It’s hard to convey just how big they feel as you descend upon them. The SS United is nearly double the length of both.

> Imagine descending on this massive ship and spending 30 minutes exploring its top deck. Your first dive will only scratch the surface, and only about one percent of the structure will have been explored. Now imagine coming back and diving through the promenade deck, down cavernous hallways, into cargo holds and bridge structures. Divers will be able to visit this site 100 times and not see the same area twice.

There’s been a fair amount of controversy in turning the SS United States into an underwater reef, with several historical societies [arguing against the project](https://www.nycsavessus.org/). However, after being docked for 30 years in Philadelphia with no progress on a land-based solution, a permanent resting place underwater (with a small museum onshore) seems a fine compromise. I’m excited to dive it. If all goes to plan, planners will sink the ship 21 nautical miles southwest of Destin-Fort Walton Beach to coincide with the annual DEMA dive show this November.
