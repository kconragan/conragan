In addition to his always prescient take on technology, turns out Om Malik is also a fountain pen geek.

From a piece titled [The Patina of Words](https://omlovespens.com/2025/11/07/the-patina-of-words/):

> Maybe I love old things because they are layered with mystery, softened by time. Marcel Proust wrote, “Remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of how things were.” I like the idea that vintage objects carry not just history but imagination. There’s something profoundly human about loving things that have lived before us.

Excited to add this to my RSS feed.
