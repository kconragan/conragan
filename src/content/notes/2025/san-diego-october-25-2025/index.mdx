In the San Diego Airport after a week in San Diego. A work conference followed by a dive trip off Catalina with the Sundiver Express. I logged 3 dives. Here's a short edit of the highlights.

I also had some time to walk around downtown La Jolla and took my FujiFilm X-T3 and my 35mm 1.4 lens for some street photography.
