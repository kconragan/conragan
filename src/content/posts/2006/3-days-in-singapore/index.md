We’ve been in Singapore for the past three days on a visa run, and wow, what a change from Bali. After spending a week in the quiet fishing village of Candi Dasa on Bali’s east coast (more on that in another post), Singapore has been quite a culture shock: high-speed underground subways, towering skyrises, and malls as far as the eye can see.

But there is more to Singapore beyond initial impressions. Most people seem to think that Singapore is a sterile place; one dominated by obsessively clean streets, glimmering white sidewalks, and towering modern highrises. While true, one only needs to take a walk through the Tekka Market of Little India on a weekday morning or the narrow backstreets of Chinatown at night to experience a people and place alive with texture, culture, and vibrancy.

One downside of Singapore for the budget traveler is that it is expensive. It is certainly one of the most expensive countries to visit in Southeast Asia. We chose to stay in the area known as Little India as we had heard there were relatively affordable guesthouses to be found.
When Singapore was a small but growing colony in the 1820s, the British brought in Indian workers, who established the neighborhood of Little India. The British had a policy of ethnic segregation. The segregation no longer exists today, even though Little India is still very much a taste of Indian culture. We secured a small room at the Little India Guesthouse. The rooms here are basic and clean enough, but at $40 per night (Singapore) they were about as much as we could afford. Our first room had a few bedbugs, but when we told the management, they quickly gave us a new room that was bedbug-free. The room had just a single window, a bedside table, bunk bed, and a small AC unit. With the atmosphere of a small prison cell, neither of us wanted to spend very much time in our room, so we spent our days and nights walking the streets and different districts of Singapore.

As we were staying in Little India, we started each day at the wonderful Tekka Market, which was just a few blocks away from our guesthouse and on the way to the subway station. Tekka Market is the largest wet market in Singapore and an absolute feast for the senses. Here you can get fruits and vegetables of all shapes and colors, fish, meat, spices, and just about anything else you can think of, including jackfruit, manta rays, and black-skin chickens. There is an excellent food center, where dozens of stalls hawk food of myriad ethnic varieties.
We especially loved the ginger tea the Indian stalls served, which became a daily ritual for us. They prepare the tea with strong powdered ginger, hot water, and sweetened condensed milk, and then froth it by pouring the liquid between two pitchers, with arms stretched far apart for dramatic effect (and additional aeration). They make and serve coffee the same way, which is also excellent. For breakfast, it’s egg pratas. A cook takes thin, bread-like dough and stretches it out like a pizza before placing an egg in the center and adding onions and jalapeños. They then fold the dough into a tidy pocket around the egg. The vendor cooks the dough on a flat grill until it achieves a golden color on both sides. They offer it with a savory red curry sauce that differs by vendor, but the prata itself is delicious enough to enjoy plain.

The government requires all food stalls in Singapore to display their cleanliness rating publicly. With this, you can sample a variety of new foods and flavors without the anxiety that can come with new cuisine in a foreign country. We ate only at stalls that were graded either an A or a B, though we don’t recall ever seeing a stall with a C grade (or lower), a compliment to the excellent health standard.

After breakfast in the market, we would descend into the MRT—Mass Rapid Transit — to visit other areas throughout the city. Singapore has an amazingly efficient public transportation system; it is extremely fast, clean, and affordable and should be a model for other cities and nations still lacking in this extremely important service. The MRT connects you to all parts of the city, and public buses fill in the gaps. Malls are at the base of most MRT stations, and Singapore has more malls than we have ever seen. The designers of modern Singapore designed it so that citizens never have to go outdoors because the climate is extremely hot and very muggy, according to our theory. Indeed, when you get downtown, it feels as if the entire city is one giant, interconnected mall linked by underpasses, overpasses, and more escalators than you could imagine in one place. (One day we tried to count how many escalators we rode but lost count at over 100). Businesspeople in sharp suits commute to and from work through the malls—never exposing themselves to the outdoors. The malls here have much more than simple clothing stores and beauty products: fine grocery stores are in the basement of many malls, as are day spas and excellent restaurants.

We spent nearly two days wandering through malls. With all this consumerism, it was difficult not to purchase anything, but with many months of travel ahead of us, our bank account and our backpacks couldn’t handle unnecessary purchases. We did, however, pick up a few items. We purchased a new power converter as our last one’s fuse blew, and our PowerBook has been zapping us whenever it’s plugged in ever since. Our second purchase is much more exciting: we got an underwater housing for our Canon S-80. We had considered buying this before our trip, but waited until we were sure we would use it. After some excellent snorkelling in Bali though, we both agreed we wanted to take pictures in the water. We’ve also decided we are going to get our PADI Advanced Open Water Dive Certification completed when we return to Bali. After hearing so many stories from the many divers in Candi Dasa—including near-guaranteed sightings of manta rays at Manta Point–we can’t pass up the opportunity.

Chinatown differs from our San Francisco Chinatown. For starters, it’s impeccably clean. The food stalls all have A ratings, but the area still has a vibrant market that stimulates both the eyes and the stomach. It was here that we discovered a teahouse called the Tea Chapter—the largest teahouse in Singapore, and one of the best we have ever seen. We enjoyed several hour long tea sessions here. We had an excellent oolong tea and finally some pu-er—our first since we left Hawaii, and hopefully foreshadows the still to come as we head north into China. Our fascination with tea seemed to amuse the teahouse staff, who were extremely friendly. The actual drinking of tea takes place on the second and third floors. The first floor is a huge showroom of tea and teaware. They had an enormous variety of tea and a greater variety of teapots in one place than we have ever seen. They also had the largest teapot we have ever seen–it is so big it takes at least five people to pour it. Two of the most expensive teapots we have seen are also here, at $16,000 a piece. (It’s a good thing our cat is far away since she has a talent for breaking expensive teaware).

That concludes our time in Singapore (for now). We are now at Changi International Airport, which is an experience all its own. The MRT runs directly into the terminal, making travel to and from the city a breeze. Like the rest of the country, the airport offers a wide assortment of stores, food stalls, a free movie theater, free internet, a rooftop swimming pool, and even free Xbox stations. Our flight to Bali departs in an hour, so we plan to enjoy the amenities until then.

Good to hear from you. A big city experience Singapore style and now you
are headed back the beach. Photos and narrative are truly entertaining
and we can hardly wait for the next post. Will you be able to remain in
Bali for another 30 days or what? Hope all is well. Hi Julie. Love –
George

Hi Guys, I noticed many of the signs had ”$” for prices. Do they use
American dollars as a currency? Great pictures. The tea room was
beautiful. I hope you were able to leave the 3 surf boards in Bali. You
didn’t mention lugging them around. Can’t wait for the next story.  
Love, Dianne

Fortunately we were able to leave the surfboards and some other
belongings at Bingin with Lynie and Gung, the family who runs the
bungalows we stay at there. Unfortunately, my bag still feels too heavy,
I need to get rid of some more stuff.

Singapore uses it’s own currency but they are referred to as dollars.
The current exchange rate for U.S. dollars is about $S1.57/$US1. And
yes, we’ll be in Bali for another 30 days if anyone is interested in
dropping by for some snorkelling and massages.. :-)

Pooer! Pooer! Heehee. It is good to see that some things never change
and that in a giant bustling city you managed to find your way to a tea
store. It makes me me miss you!  
And yes, I will work on getting my buns over to Bali…wouldn’t that be
great…(sigh).

I would’ve loved to see both of your expressions as you walked into that
tea store. How are you resisting the urge to buy some of the cool things
you’re seeing?! Or should we expect to see you lugging a giant teapot
back on the plane?? that makes me smile just thinking about it. :)

It took some serious restraint to not buy everything in the Tea Chapter
store. It was Disneyland for us! Kai said that I would have to carry the
teapot myself so we left empty handed. Next time….

The airport sounds super-cool. A swimming pool on the roof! The whole
place sounds fantastical. Instead of going to the movies this summer,
I’ll be tuning into your blog. Thanks.
