We said goodbye today to a wonderful couple we met here in Bali: Maria and Nuno, who are from Lisbon, Portugal. After three weeks in Bali, including a week searching for surf on a boat tour of the surrounding islands, they’re going home. We had a wonderful time getting to know them. Besides Portuguese, Maria speaks English and German fluently. She works for Eastpak, a backpack manufacturer, where she started as a translator but has recently moved into sales and forecasting. Nuno owns a surf school in Portugal, Surf Lab, where he coaches young surfers, honing their abilities in the Lisbon beachbreaks. He is a great surfer; a smooth goofyfoot and wave magnet in the water. It’s sad to see them go, but we’ve exchanged contact info and promised to visit them if we make it to Portugal someday.

Next we departed for Nusa Dua, a resort town on the Bukit Pennsulia. Nusa Dua emerged in the 1970s as a tourist destination with its good beaches and sparse population. Designed as a resort town, it provides tourists with familiar comforts but also feels quite sheltered from the “real” Bali. It took a big business hit after the 2002 nightclub bombings and, while business has increased in the subsequent years, it still feels like a paradise lost.

On the drive from Bingin we passed through Kulah village, where the people were busy getting ready for a big ceremony on the 3rd of May. Bamboo poles erected for the ceremony lined the street, providing a 20 foot high canopy with tassels dangling from the tops. Gamelan music projected from nearby homes along the road.

The long, sandy beach of Nusa Dua is the perfect place to sit back and relax, framed between fancy hotels and temple-lined cliffs. Kai was restless with no pounding surf or anything else dangerous he could subject himself to, but I was happy swimming in the calm waters. The water here is much cooler than along the Bukit Peninsula. This is also the windward side, so the air is noticeably cooler. The beach has a restaurant, pricy at almost $6 for lunch, but conveniently located. They have chaise lounges out front in the shade. You must pay for the newer ones, but the old ones in the shade are fine and free.

Down the beach from the white umbrellas and chaise lounges, locals were bustling on the shore, so we walked down to get a closer look. A labyrinth of handmade fences stood in the shallows of the water, and men, women, and children knelt at the water’s edge, working fastidiously. Upon closer inspection, they were harvesting seaweed. They farm it here, using the fences to corridor their crops from the water flow outside. They first collect small amounts of seaweed and then plant it along the fence in tidy rows. In this controlled environment, the seaweed grows more quickly. They then harvest it, replant small amounts, and repeat the process over and over. They harvest the seaweed for carrageenan–an emulsifying agent–which is used to thicken many foods, including ice cream. The seaweed — all seaweed, in fact—is edible. We sampled a bit. It had a crunchy texture and surprisingly light taste; it wasn’t nearly salty as one would expect.

Caption: Carried in boats close to shore, the farmers then bring the seaweed up the beach in handmade baskets.

After rinsing the sand off, we headed into the main part of Nusa Dua, passing upscale hotels. There are many beachfront restaurants that offer cuisine from all parts of the world, including Greek and Japanese. The restaurants here are pricey for our traveling budget, so we drove further up the road and found a quaint noodle house with cheaper prices. We had chicken noodle soup with fresh-made Chinese noodles, a pleasant change from Bali’s usual instant Mie noodles.

That’s it for now. Please keep posting comments. They make this site so much fun for us!

It’s amazing how folks travel to the other side of the world, just to
have “western” food they could get at home. Sometimes being on a budget
is a much more life enriching way to travel. Very interesting about the
seaweed too. I’ll think of you as i dig into my Phish Food tonight!

Hi, Great pictures and what an exciting trip you are having. Douglas &
Sturges uses seaweed to make a molding compound that is not bad for
making mold of your skin and body parts. Look forward to seeing more of
your adventures. Best regards, John

Hi Julie, I love reading about your view of Bali. Of coures you would be
lead to something connected to ice cream! The pictures are wonderful. I
had tried to imagine what sea weed farms would like before, when I read
about them. I wonder if in Japan it’s more automated.

I’m sure you’ll miss your friends from Portugal. If you decide to head
in that direction, I have some sites I would really like you to visit.
My sister Linda is still working on her book about our geaneology. As
you know my father’s family is from Portugal and the Azores. I love
checking your site hoping for a new post. I share them with everyone at
Palcare. You know how scared they all are of technology, so don’t expect
anyone to leave you a post, but we all share your adventures, even Joan!
She still hasn’t won the lottery for us. Oh well.

George and I are going out tonite to celebrate with Mark and Jan. Today
is Mark’s 50th birthday. Love you both. Dianne

Wow! I envy you two. What a wonderful way to travel. I am enjoying
reading about your adventures. It’s about as close as I can get. You
both are great writers. Maybe if I went on a seaweed diet…......on
second thought, forget it! I’ll go with the ice cream.

Hmmm, the “at-times-too-warm water”.... JB, you know that’s not nice to
share with those of us sitting at our desks at work.

I agree Katie, I can see Julie’s smile getting wider as she pictures our
office-bound bodies getting paler from lack of sunlight, while she gets
tanner by the day. And now we said goodbye to the winter rain (finally!)
and gone right into summer fog. Grrrr! Hope you are enjoying that warm
water girly because there is surely none here!

I like to see the pictures of Kai surfing (down the mountains on the top
of the waves) and Julie swimming. Take more.

Ice cream. See? I always new that ice cream was good for you—it has
seaweed in it and seaweed is good for you. So ice cream is kind of like
eating sushi, sans fish.  
I can rationalize anything.  
Julie B—I am going to the dump soon and I think of you. You and
mountians of carpet scraps that somehow make you so happy. Miss you!

Hi! I just got back to work and you can’t imagine how surprised I was to
see a picture of me and nuno in your website! It was very hard to come
back, especially when you leave behind such a great island, culture and
also friends. I can imagine you waking up early and having breakfast…
those delicious pancakes… I just wish I could snap my fingers and be
there… well, that is at the momet impossible, so I just want to tell you
that it was wonderfull meeting you both and also that you are welcomed
anytime. Love, Maria

Hey Julie & Kai,

It is wonderful that you have met so many gracious and fun people along
your journey already. It is nice to see all the beautiful and
interesting photos you are taking. Thank you for sharing your trip with
all of us. I hope that your highest and best continues to unfold before
you effortlessly. I look forward to more photos and stories.

Seaweed and ice cream…strange.

Joy and Blessings,

Hi Julie and Kai. How is the surfing, Kai? I am over at Aunt Marty’s
house in Upper Lake. We are going to go to Ukiah and look for
civilization and yoga classes. ;) What else is new… I moved again! Back
to Tomales. So Kai, when you and Julie return, maybe we’ll find some
time to hang out and surf together. I met this young woman named
Savannah who is born the day after me (another Capricorn, Julie!) and
she used to be a surfing champ down south. I am hoping she might teach
me how… we got to know each other at Rainbow’s End Farm, the
permaculture farm in Occidental. Your blog is just outstanding. I love
reading it, and your language is entertaining to read. Both of your
turns of phrases, etc. It’s just the same way when you talk, so reading
your blog definitely brings you closer to us. I love you. Talk with you
soon…
