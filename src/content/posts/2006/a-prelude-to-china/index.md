When planning our trip, Julie and I both struggled over whether we should travel through Central and South America or Asia. Julie has studied a great deal about Latin American art and has a genuine interest and knowledge that would have made a trip there rewarding. It also wouldn’t have hurt that I speak a fair amount of Spanish. As is obvious, however, we came to Asia instead.

Asia appealed to us for two reasons. First, it was (and still is) completely foreign to us. Julie and I have traveled through parts of Latin America including Mainland Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, and Baja California. While we certainly aren’t experts, we felt we knew what to expect. Asia, in contrast, was completely unknown to us. We would be strangers in a strange land. The second reason is, well, tea.

### A Short and Highly Subjective Overview of Tea

Many people would laugh at the idea of traveling to the opposite end of the earth out of a curiosity in tea. I would agree. But then, wine tours in many parts of the world are a major tourist draw, so why should tea be different?

For reasons that could fill a book, most people in America prefer coffee to tea. The Boston Tea Party certainly contributed to the demise of tea in America, though it also means the government does not tax tea, even today. In short, for most Americans, tea means Lipton, Snapple, or, at the boutique end, Republic of Tea. While there is nothing wrong with these, this spectrum of tea is the equivalent of wine in a box. There is a plethora of tea out there: green tea that virgins once picked wearing white gloves; oolong tea from plants that grow on steep cliffs, making the picking so difficult farmers would teach monkeys to do it for them; Pu-er tea that merchants place in large bamboo canisters and age for years deep inside dark, damp caves to bring out the full flavor.

Second to water, tea is the oldest beverage—far older than wine. Nations fought wars over tea; poets wrote beautiful prose about it; connoisseurs perfected the brewing and intricate ceremony; and societies used tea throughout history as currency. Even today, investors buy and store it in tea banks as it ages

And if you think tea is cheap, note that a bidder recently won [500 grams of high-quality Wu Li Qing green tea for $17,000](https://www.teaspring.com/Wu-Li-Qing.asp), more expensive than gold.

But to me, tea’s beauty lies in its simplicity: the mindfulness it brings when properly enjoyed. But there is also a culture and history that is complex and fascinating. It is this that brings us to the birthplace of tea: China. Yes, we go to China in search of tea.

### China

Some 5,000 years ago, a Chinese emperor named [Shen Nung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_Nung) stopped for a rest while on a walk through the countryside. Tired, he had his servant boil some water to drink. (Shen Nung was, among other things, a scientist who believed boiling water was helpful for hygienic reasons). While the water was boiling, leaves from a plant fell into the pot. Infused with the leaves, the water turned brown. Most people at this time would have discarded the water, but Shen Nung was a curious emperor. He had a deep interest in agriculture. Indeed, his very name means the Divine Farmer. He discovered hundreds of herbs for medicinal use, most of which he tried himself before passing to his nation. And so, on this day, as chance would have it, a few little leaves landed in his boiling pot as he rested from a long walk. Rather than discard them, he tried it, found the taste pleasing, and from such humble beginnings tea was born.

For all it’s history, tea remains mysterious to the outside observer. Families closely guard farming and processing techniques passed down from generations past. Questions will usually get you nowhere for fear of giving up long-held secrets. Questions that receive an answer usually have as much fact in them as fairytales. Westerners have the added disadvantage of not speaking Mandarin,and most information that is available lies in Mandarin in old books. For all these reasons, and more, journey to the source to experience tea and its culture firsthand.

The problem, of course, is that China is not a country where most people spend their day picking tea leaves, practicing calligraphy, and meditating upon the profundity of a rock. It is a waking giant, huge in scale and determined to grab a stronghold in the modern world. Development is occurring at a rate that is unfathomable, spurred on by the forthcoming 2008 Olympics, to be held in Beijing. And development will occur at all costs: the government has uprooted millions of citizens and moved them into Chicago-size cities to make way for roads, dams, and other infrastructure. Cities are popping up so quickly that maps just a few years old don’t include cities with over a million residents. Yes, present-day China is a big, dynamic, overpopulated place. But despite all this, pockets of the old China still exist. Just the other day, the [New York Times published a wonderful interactive piece on an old teahouse in Hangzhou](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2006/07/02/travel/20060702_tra_TEAHOUSE_FEATURE.html) (you really should check it out). We seek these hidden pockets as we enter China.

### General Itinerary

China is huge. Really. It’s big. As such, we must focus on regions with certain tea history rather than embark on an all-encompassing tour of China that would take, well, a lifetime. Tea harvesting, according to the best historical documents, originated in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. So we will spend most of our time there. We have spent many hours pouring over tea books, websites, and anything else we could find with information regarding tea. We have created a shortlist of places we’d like to visit, and our itinerary will largely be based on stringing these locations together (if you can call “stringing together” train rides over 40 hours). Some of these locations include:

- **The Six Tea Mountains**: In far, southern Yunnan, lore says that tea harvesting began here.
- **Kunming**: A town with long tea-trading roots. It is outside of Kunming that our favorite tea, Pu-er, was born.
- **Hangzhou**: Famous for its Longjing, or Dragon Well tea, this is one of the most accessible tea-specific areas in China, complete with a tea festival in spring.
- **Yixing**: The town where the famous Yixing clay is from, used for making traditional Gung-fu teapots.

There will of course be many other locations. These are just starting points for our trip. We are also considering a trip on the recently finished China-Tibet train, which first started running on July 1, 2006, making Tibet more accessible than ever. It sounds like quite an adventure: a 3-day train ride leading over 16,000-foot mountains, high enough that the train includes oxygen masks (which drop from the ceiling like airplanes) should passengers experience altitude sickness.

Will our tea journey succeed? Or will modern China force us to retreat to somewhere easy, like Thailand? Whether we succeed or not, tea runs deep within Chinese culture, and will prove a fascinating lens for exploring the country.

Hi! I spent 4 awesome months in Yunnan, back in 1999. I’m sure it’s
changed plenty since then, but I have a couple ideas for you folks. I
spent most of the time between Kunming and Deqen in the far northwest.
In fact, if you want to have some Tibetan experience on the cheap, I’d
recommend heading into Northwest Yunnan, parts of which are Tibetan
autonomous prefecures (such as Zhongdian and Deqen) that are
ridiculously beautiful. If you like hiking and botany, there’s a dude in
Deqen named Zhang Hua that has a car and would take you to amazing
places, explaining all the plants (when I was there, he charged about 10
bucks per day.)  
In Dali, there’s a wacky guy named Dr. He who whips up his own secret
medicinal teas (the cure cancer, blindness, you name it—at least that’s
what he claims…)  
There’s plenty of dramatic hiking in NW Yunnan (The Nature Conservancy
is assisting a project in most of the area called the Great Rivers
project—check out their website for info). Hiking through Tiger Leaping
Gorge is amazing, so is hiking around Meilixueshan.  
Outside of Kunming, there’s a bizarre artist, whose name is Luo Xing if
I remember correctly, who has assembled a bunch of incredible musicians
from around the province. It’s pretty fresh.  
If you like to visit temples, there are beautiful ones everywhere,
carved into cliff faces, perching on ridges, everywhere. Jizushan is a
good one, a few hours from Kunming.  
But most important: drink all the baijiu you can. And eat some fanqie
chao tofu for me. Oooh, and in Kunming they make this heartstopping
breakfast food, a big deep-fried donut-like item, covered in a sweet
peanut butter goop, wrapped in a rice flour tortilla… ahhhh…  
Contact me if you have any questions— Emily’s little brother Paul’s
friend Aaron

Oh, and I should have said, you can follow the path of the Tea and Horse
road, a very old and scenic trading route between Yunnan and its
neighbors west.

Sounds like a wonderful itenerary, hopefully with lots of pics of the
plants harvested for various teas. It was great talking to you, though i
still miss a good hug, but that day will come again. Enjoy your journey.
Tibet should be special. Have a cup for me. Love -GV

China at last! How exciting! I am impressed with your knowledge of tea.
It is reassuring to know that you are both okay and doing fine on the
road. Miss you but vicariously enjoy your experience.

Love—PHK

Hi, One of my favorite things about tea is the culture. It is still
perfectly acceptable in many parts of the world to say it’s “Tea Time”
and people sit down and have a cup of tea and talk and enjoy a brief
respite from the day. This is an accepted important part of the day. I
love it. My tea times started with my Grandmother treating me very
special by letting me have tea with her and using a china tea cup
beautifully decorated, even though I was only three. My sisters and I
created our own tea parties, always with a vase of flowers on our table
and real tea cups. One of my favorite memories is of you, Julie and
Parker sitting and having tea in the mornings before going off and
starting your day. I miss you! Can’t wait to hear about your adventures.
Love, Dianne

Kai-  
Sounds like you might be able to mix a little business and pleasure.
Have you thought about getting into the tea importing and distribution
business?

Jesse-

We’re definitely keeping our options open if an opportunity presents
itself. The language barrier would make any real negotiations pretty
tough—certainly would require a translator—and contracts in China mean
next to nil, so you stand a good chance of getting screwed if you’re not
careful. That being said, could be a good side gig and good excuse to
make it out to this part of the world more consistently.
