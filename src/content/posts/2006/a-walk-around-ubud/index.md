The kindness of the Balinese people continues to amaze me. Julie and I
stood dripping on the side of the road, hiding in some shade offered by
a tree from the mid-day sun. What had drawn us to this spot, besides the
shade, was the music. Following the advice of [Lonely
Planet](http://lonelyplanet.com) we had set out earlier in the morning
for a walk outside of [Ubud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubud).

We started with a visit to the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary to get a
look at the grey-haired, long-tailed [Balinese
Macacques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque). The sanctuary is
nestled at the southern end of Ubud and houses three holy temples in
addition to the curious monkeys. The sanctuary is admittedly touristy,
but the monkeys are a delight to watch. They wrestle with each other,
make faces at you, and generally carry on in a playful manner. But there
is a softer side to them too, and it’s hard not to feel an empathy with
them. Perhaps it’s the expressions in their face or the way a mother and
father tenderly holds their newborn, maybe I’m just a sucker.

The monkeys have become very used to humans, and they scurry up to you
when you enter the park, hoping you’ve brought them a banana. If you
have none, as we did not, they give you a look of disgust and go about
wrestling with each other. It was sitting on the steps of a walkway that
one of the monkeys got his revenge for not having received his banana: I
felt what I thought were a few raindrops on the bill of my hat, only to
look up and realize too late that the drops were monkey piss, and the
culprit monkey was shrieking with glee and shaking himself.

Emerging from the cool shade brought by the canopy of trees and into the
already blazing sun, we continued our walk. Though small and narrow, the
road down which we walked was constantly humming with motor scooters. We
walked passed myriad Batik woodcarving shops, each displaying their
goods of carved turtles, dolphins, elephants and larger carvings of
Hindu gods and goddesses. Each little shop had a hand-painted sign,
usually with just their name and smaller letters below stating “Made to
Order”. Everything can be made to order. The local artisans have
realized that they can make a living catering to the Westerners who want
carved statues for their gardens and small shops back home. Yet it is
sad to see that there is very little creativity or originality to these
carvings. The artists are obviously talented, yet much of what they
produce looks repetitive, mass-produced even. The Balinese for centuries
have produced beautiful works of art, from stone statues to wood carving
to ornate and elaborate paintings. Yet all of the artwork was for a
purpose: religion and, more specifically, the decoration of temples. It
wasn’t until Westerners arrived that Balinese began producing art
strictly for art (or a buck’s) sake, and even then only with a little
encouragment from enterprizing visitors. As such, it seems the Balinese
have not been able, or perhaps willing, to transfer their talent and
creativity to the open-market.

We continued our walk down the busy street, the sun now scorching in the
mid-day heat. It was here that we found ourselves, dripping in sweat, me
with monkey piss on my hat, that we heard the music. It sounded like
traditional Balinese music, of which we had been hearing a lot of in the
numerous shops of Ubud. But this music was different, it was live.
Flutes rang out in harmony while a strong rhythm of percussion
instruments drove the music forward. It was coming from across the
street from what appeared to be a family compound. The short set of
stairs leading to the entrance were covered in beautiful orange flowers.
Palm fronds lined the stairs and rose up and over the entrance, swaying
in the breeze like party streamers. A man in a dark blue sarong and
linen colored shirt motioned for us to come over. We approached slowly,
unsure if we had disrupted a procession in our staring. He motioned for
us more eagerly as we approached, and then gestured for us to come in.
Stepping through the ornately carved gateway was like stepping into
another world. The music we had heard from the street was now clear and
vibrant. All around us were colors manifesting in myriad forms: Yellow
silk waved lazily in the sun and pink and purple ornaments hung from
orantely carved stone statues. Directly in front of us were two 8 foot
tall sculptures, all entirely made out of food, from brightly colored
rice crackers to sugar and coconut. The man who had invited us in handed
us each a bamboo plate and gestured for us to help ourselves to some
snacks that were on hand and simply said, “*Welcome to our wedding*”.

The man’s name was Made (second born) and his brother, the groom, was
the one getting married. The bride and groom were dressed in traditional
Balinese wedding outfits. The woman wore a pink, silk dress with yellow
lining and an elaborate gold headdress. The man wore matching colors
with a black and silver jacket and a traditional Balinese dagger on his
back. They sat in chairs and greeted each guest. The food on hand was
simply mouth-watering. Giant bamboo baskets held white rice. Dishes were
placed all around the baskets including *babi guling* (spit roast pig),
grilled whole fish with spicy chili pepper sauce, slow-cooked spiced
chicken, pickled cucumbers and carrots, and chicken and red peper satay
with sugarcane. We helped ourselves to a little of all of it.

This is the kindness which I speak about in Bali. This family invited
two strangers in off the street to their wedding, one with monkey piss
on his hat, both dripping in sweat and neither with an appropriate
sarong or sash. They made us feel welcome and insisted we we eat their
food though certainly it, and indeed the whole day, had come at great
financial cost to the family. After the bride and groom departed, Julie
and I bid our thanks to the family and headed back to downtown Ubud
elated with the experience.

Back at our room at the Sayong House, we sat lazily on our balcony that
overlooks downtown and watched the sun drop behind the mountains. Ubud
is charming, reminiscent of Berkely, or perhpas Santa Cruz, another
traveler we met even mentioned Italy: Narrow streets lined with small
boutiques, used book stores, and shops selling silk sarongs, local
paintings and carvings. There are a plethora of great, cheap places to
eat. Exhausted from the 12km walk and the heat, we decided to splurge
and treat ourselves to a 1 hour, full-body massage. The cost was $6
each.

How wonderful. It’s a great day when you can be afforded the “kindness
of strangers” and experience a local happening not geared up for your
tourist dollars. I hope you have many more such experiences. The pics
are incredible – the colors are so bright and vivid. Keep them coming.
Love – GV

Hi, I looked at the pictures in the gallery before I read the article. I
was curious about the beautiful couple. What a wonderfull experience it
be included at such a beautiful event. It’s the everyday people that
offer hope for our world and search for peace.  
I look forward to each article and am reminded about what a great writer
you are Kai. You have been concentrating on other talents for many
years. I love the photographs. Each one is a window into a world I would
love to experience.

I would like to hear a little more from Julie. Can you get custom made
clothing using those beautiful fabrics? I know you are traveling light,
but what a temptation.

I love you both. Mom
