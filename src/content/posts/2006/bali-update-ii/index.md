Update time everybody…

We’ve spent the last week back on the Bukit Peninsula. A solid run of
swells has delivered us with a week of great surf. For all that Bali has
to offer, it is ultimately the waves that drew me out here so I must
admit I’ve been doing little more than eating, sleeping, and surfing as
of late. Our run of swells will come to a close by the end of the month,
at which time Julie and I plan to head to the east coast of Bali. Back
in Ubud we met a Scottish man – a doctor turned veterinarian – who lives
in Germany with his wife but spends three months each year in Bali. He
invited us to to meet him in Candidasa, where he promised us a tour of
some of the better beaches and diving spots on his boat in exchange for
a few beers.

We’ve been staying at Bingin, which is a beach centrally located between
all of the great surf spots of this area. Our accommodations are at the
Pondok Indah (which means *beautiful house* ), which is a small
collection of bungalows owned and operated by the wonderful Lynie and
her husband Gung. Lynie is an extraordinary host and her kindness and
hospitality has led the place to be commonly known as *Lynie’s*. A good
sign of any accommodation: nearly all of the guests at Lynie’s are
return visitors.

Bingin, and indeed the whole peninsula, is very isolated. This offers a
welcome respite from the constant hustling of the Kuta area. However, it
also means that everything is hard to get to. The roads are bad and
there are very few cab drivers in the area, which makes getting around
by hired driver both time consuming and expensive. If you do decide to
use a hired driver, agree on a price before you get into the vehicle. We
had one driver who tried to charge us nearly double after we had arrived
at our destination, using the bad roads as an excuse.

I think it’s safe to say that if you plan on spending any amount of time
in Bali, it’s best to get your own transportation. Driving can
admittedly be nerve wracking: for westerners, driving on the left-hand
side of the road is awkward, and the constant traffic can be unsettling.
In fact, driving in downtown Kuta or Denpasar can be downright
frightening. To start with, the lines painted on the road indicating
lanes are really more of a suggestion than a boundary. As are traffic
signals. Cars and scooters drive in either lane or against traffic at
whim. If a guy on a scooter needs to go a mile up the road, it’s
perfectly reasonable for him to drive on the wrong side of the road for
that mile instead of having to pull out across traffic into the correct
lane. If you are making a right-hand turn (the equivalent of a left-hand
turn across traffic at home), cars and scooters will pass you on the
right while you are trying to turn. Essentially, there is an unwritten
rule while driving in Bali that says the driver is responsible for
whatever gets in front of his/her bumper. If a car pulls out in front
you (they never actually look to see if a car is coming), it is your
responsibility to not hit the other car. Ultimately, when driving in
Bali, you have to ignore all the rules you learned at home and just go
with the flow of traffic. However, the payoff is much more freedom to
explore the island at your leisure. You don’t have to deal with
bargaining with hired drivers or worry that they are taking you to a
place where they receive a commission.

With all of this in consideration, Julie and I decided it was time to
get our own transportation. We started with a motor scooter, which we
rented for about $4 US a day. Motor scooters are by far the most popular
– and practical – form of transportation on the island. The maze of
roads and amount of traffic make driving a car an ordeal, whereas on a
scooter you can just zip through the traffic and down the side roads.
Fortunately, there is very little traffic at Bingin and the surrounding
area, so Julie and I found that we were often the only ones on the road,
and we could drive the country roads at a slow and enjoyable pace.
Indeed, I think it’s safe to say, my dear friends and family, that I’ve
peddled my mountain bike uphill faster than I drove the scooter, so fear
not.

The scooter was nice, but neither Julie or I wanted to take it back into
the Kuta where the traffic and roads are much more demanding. As such,
we traded in the scooter for a car. We rented a Suzuki Katana, and were
able to negotiate a very reasonable price of $65,000 rupiah/day, or
about $7 US/day. I hadn’t driven a car on the left-hand side of the road
since we were in New Zealand, so it took a little while to get used to
shifting the manual transmission with my left hand instead of right, but
all in all it has worked out just fine. I’m happy to say that Julie has
done very well driving on the opposite side of the road as well, and she
has taken several trips into Kuta and Denpasar on her own.

As mentioned, we’ll be heading to the east coast of Bali in a few days.
Before that, however, on May 3, Bali will hold a large religious
celebration. Julie and I have been invited to attend with the family
with which we are staying. The ceremony we’ll be visiting will be at the
temple at Uluwatu. After that our plans are tentative at best. Our
30-day tourist visas expire on May 12. We’ve purchased tickets to
Singapore for May 10, where we can go and then return to Bali to renew
our visa. The tickets we purchased to Singapore cost us $200 a piece
through Singapore Airlines (more than we had anticipated paying), but
they allow us to stay in Singapore for up to two weeks. Essentially, we
can decide which day we want to return to Bali within a 14 day window.
If we are enjoying Singapore, we’ll likely stay for a week or so. If
not, we’ll simply get on a flight back to Bali, where we plan to stay
for one more month before we begin making our way up to Thailand.

Hi guys, It’s a good thing you finally came up with a picture of Julie.
I was convinced she had run off with a hot Balinese pearl diver and you
were afraid to tell us. Julie you look great!  
Love you, Dianne

Julie, you are a bombshell. That’s it – you have kids and I’ll be
auntie. I don’t have those kinds of genes to pass on!!

Hey guys,

Stumbled onto your website while searching for contact details for
Lynie’s place at Bingin. Would you by any chance have a current email
address for Lynie’s? Unfortunately the email address I have from my last
visit is not working.  
I have stayed here a couple of times & am looking forward to returning
next March.  
Best wishes & happy travels!

Cheers,  
Chris
