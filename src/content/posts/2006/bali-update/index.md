# Bali Update

Just a quick update…

of Pineapple and Banana Jaffle</span>

We’ve spent the past 3 days hanging out Ubud, checking out the local art
and doing some walks through the rural countryside. We stayed at the
Sayong House, which is located in the middle of central Ubud near many
great restaurants and shops. Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a
lovely view of the Balinese rooftops and the stream that flows through
the center of town. The room itself is very clean and simple, with two
beds (one queen the other a single) and a small lockable wardrobe. Every
thing in the bathroom is a dizzying blue and purple, and it had a
bathtub with a hand shower and hot water. The rate for the room included
breakfast: we had jaffles with bannana and pineapple and omelletes.

We’re currently eating lunch at the Bali Buddha Cafe in Ubud waiting for
our transport to take us back down to the Bukit Peninsula. A new swell
is forecasted to hit tomorrow so it’s back to the beach for us.

We haven’t posted with as much frequency as we’d like to, partly due to
limited internet access but also partly due to the time it takes to put
together a well-written post complete with photos. As such, we are going
to start putting up quick updates in addition to our longer, more
narrative posts. The quick posts will be more nuts and bolts
orienated—where we are staying, what we’ve been up to, etc.—which
hopefully will keep everyone a bit more up-to-date with our daily life.
Let us know what you think.

In the meantime, we’ve posted some [our first set of images from Bali to
the gallery](/gallery/), so go check them out. We also just put up a new
post about a [walk through
Ubud](http://www.somedaynevercomes.com/article/a-walk-around-ubud).

Hello to you both! I know the wonderful feeling of waking up each day to
a new adventure…and i’m so jealous that you are experiencing it right
now!  
I love the short posts, anything is better than nothing. I have you
saved in my favorites bar, and check on you almost every day.  
My best advice for travelling with a partner for an extended length of
time, is to schedule some individual time every week. It’ll give you
each a chance to breath and experience something on your own, and talk
about over the dinner table.  
back to work for me – urgh! (stop smiling in glee)  
love, emily

I enjoy your photo and message.  
But I don’t find yourself except one on the airplane, please  
take more of your photo with local people or animals,
