Well, after 5 solid years of use, and now 4 months of hard travel
through Southeast Asia, our Titanium Powerbook has finally bit the
bullet. It may be the PMU, it may be the internal battery, or it may
simply be a bad power adapter, but the computer will no longer take a
charge. It sits lifeless.

We bought the laptop in college at [San Francisco State
University](http://sfsu.edu) in 2001, where it served us well through
numerous note taking sessions and papers. After college, it became an
administrative workhorse computer for [Crux
Studio](http://www.cruxstudio.com), the design firm I helped found.
Before leaving on our trip, Julie’s cousin Trevor—a mac guru of the
finest sort—generously reinvigorated the computer, essentially swapping
the brains into a new shell and giving it an all-around tune-up. The
computer is admittedly slow—being a first generation Titanium Powerbook
it clocks in at only 400mhz. However, Julie and I have both been through
a lot with the computer, and there’s definitely a sentimental
attachment.

Needless to say, the computer has proved extremely important on our trip
as well. With it, we are able to easily download photos, catalog them,
back them up, and generally manage the now over 5,000 images taken thus
far. Second, the computer is essential in our ability to maintain and
update this website. We write all our posts, process the images for each
post, perform updates to the site, etc., on the laptop. Doing all this
work on public computers just isn’t feasible. As such, updates on the
blog will be considerably shorter – and with far fewer photos – until we
have figured out a solution.

We are still in Semporna (more on that later, but suffice to say the
diving has been incredible), and will be flying to Johor Bahru on
Monday, July 24. From Johor Bahru, we’ll take a quick bus ride down to
Singapore, where we figure we have the best chance of getting the
computer fixed. We’re trying to remain optimistic, ignoring how
implausible it may be to to find the parts needed to repair a 5 year old
Apple laptop in this part of the world. Best case scenario would be that
battery charger has simply gone out and we can purchase a new one. Worst
case scenario is that some of the internals will need to be replaced. If
such is the case, we may have to scrap the computer all together.
Getting parts shipped here takes a good while, which would mean having
to stay in a place like Singapore or Kuala Lumpur upwards of a month
waiting for the parts to arrive.

If we’re unable to get the computer fixed, we will take a look into
getting a new laptop—most likely the new [Apple
Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/). There are two problems,
however, with purchasing a new computer. First, it’s expensive. As we’re
living on a pretty fixed income, purchasing a new computer will put a
serious dent in our budget for this trip and knock off a few of the
countries we wanted to see. Second, the Macbooks—the first generation of
Apple computers to use Intel chips—require new versions of software to
accomodate the change. This would require us purchasing all new versions
of the software we use, which is nearly as expensive as purchasing the
computer itself. It gets worse. Many smaller companies have already
updated their software to run on the new chips, however, larger
companies such as Adobe have yet to do so, as their product development
cycles are considerably longer. Of primary concern for us is
[Adobe](http://adobe.com), and specifically, [Adobe
Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/index.html), which we
use to perform all our image editing. Adobe has publically stated that
they won’t be supporting the new Intel chips until October 2006 at the
earliest. This basically means no Photoshop until then. There is a
feature in the new Macbooks called Rosetta, which allows previous
generation software to run on the new machines. We’ll have to do some
more research, but early reports seem to indicate that [performance is
severely limited](http://www.barefeats.com/rosetta.html).

We’ll keep you updated.

We can get you the employee discount and I may be able to answer some
rosetta questions for you via email – or we can make you a screaming
deal on my old TiBook 800 – I don’t know how much longer it will hold up
though :-/

there are also refurb ppc powerbooks still available that we should get
discounts on as well – let me know if we can help…

Hi guys. So sorry about the computer. Hugh was just visting me on Friday
and had bought himself the new Apple Macbook. You can boot it up as
windows or Mac, but can’t run the two systems together. I know George
might be a little busy. I could of course help by purchasing the
computer and loading all the software that I can get my hands on,
whatever is currently available for the new chip. The real hard part is
where to ship it. I can’t imagine what shape Kai will be in after days
and days of gin and tonics in Singapore. Love, Dianne

Kai’s been a bit shaky and pale the last few days, suffering from severe
withdrawl. A Singapore Sling, at the Raffles Hotel (where the drink was
invented) should fix things up and hopefully we’ll be able to sort out
our computer blues soon. And if that doesn’t work we’ll be sure to call
George… maybe he can use it as a planter box.

We’ll keep you posted on our progress.

I am dying to tell (and show) everyone about diving hopefully this
doesn’t take too long.

Hi Bun—I will miss our google chats. I was wondering where you went.

Bisous.

Dare I say it, but maybe the computer blues will be a good thing? As
much as I look forward to your updates and new pics, maybe some
computer-free time will afford you some greater relaxation and time to
just be. But this is coming from someone who shuns her computer when on
vacation or away from work… I know you guys have a very different
relationship with your computer. :)

Awe, sorry to hear about that. Whatever is wrong with it, getting it
fixed sounds like a hassle. That laptop has already died and been
resurrected a few times. I hope it has a little more life left in it.
