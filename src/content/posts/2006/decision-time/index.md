We’re in Ubud right now. Things have been busy the past two weeks – in a
good way – and we both felt the need to get away to somewhere quiet and
spend a few days regrouping. It’s hard to believe that we’ve been
traveling for over 70 days. Our time, especially here in Bali, has been
filled with diving, snorkeling, surfing, incredible food, wonderful
people, exotic ceremonies, white-knuckled driving, but not a lot of time
to sit and reflect about all of these experiences. Thus, we decided to
head for the hills, find a quiet bungalow, and spend a few days sipping
coffee and tea and taking walks through the region in order to slow
things down and spend some time reflecting, as well as looking forward.

We have 10 days left in Bali, at which time our visa expires and we need
to make some decisions about what to do next. Our original intent was to
leave Bali and head for Malaysia, making our way up the Malay peninsula
and into Thailand. This is still our general itinerary, but we’re
rethinking things a bit. Indonesia is just getting into it’s dry season,
as is Malaysia. This is a good thing. If we head further north now,
we’ll quickly hit the wet season in Thailand, as in Cambodia, Vietnam,
Laos, and Bhurma. This is a bad thing. We’re not put off by a little bit
of rain, but the rain brings brings mosquitos which brings Malaria.

Malaria.

It’s simply astonishing how much conflicting information there is out
there about Malaria. I have poured over government health websites,
travel forums, guide books, spoke with health workers, other travelers,
and still haven’t been able to get a comprehensive view of the best way
to deal with Malaria. The only summary I can give that seems to be
without conflict: The best way to prevent Malaria is to not get bit, and
if you do get bit, no prophylactic is 100% effective. Wonderful. Did I
mention side-effects?

Before we left for our trip, we each got a 3 month supply of
Doxycycline. Neither of us wanted Larium as it increases the likelihood
of getting bent when diving, not to mention it is an opiate (though
people do pay good money for that) that has been linked to suicidal
thoughts and horrible nightmares. Also, many regions in Southeast Asia
have Larium-resistant strains of Malaria, the result of misuse of the
drug. Malarone, which is the new kid on the block, has none of the side
effects of Larium and is new enough where resistance hasn’t been
established yet, but it’s extremely expensive and would have cost us
each several thousand dollars to buy enough pills to last us for the
trip. That pretty much left us with Doxycycline, a general antibiotic
that kills the good with the bad and leaves 10% of people with extreme
sun sensitivity. I can almost see the freckles on my arm laughing at me
as I type this.

Almost all travelers we’ve met on this trip so far, including a Human
Pathologist, have told us not to take the Doxycycline as a prophylactic.
It’s a shotgun approach that does more harm than good and isn’t
guaranteed to work anyway. A number of people have recommended taking
Chloroquine coupled with either Paludrin or Proguanil. Maybe I’ll just
rub citronella oil all over my body and run naked through the jungle.

Anyhow, with the wet season in hitting full swing further north, we’ve
considered our options and have come up with 3 possible itineraries.
They are:

- Continue on with our original plan by heading to Malaysia and working
  our way up to Thailand. In other words, quit worrying about Malaria
  and the perfect time to be places. We could spend a month working our
  way through Malaysia, and the better part of a month in Southern
  Thailand, where it is malarial free (only the northern part of
  Thailand, where it borders with Cambodia, is known to be Malarial). We
  could then move north as the wet season diminishes.

<!-- -->

- We could fly to Kuala Lumpur and head right back to Indonesia for
  another 1 month visa. The problem is that, as much as we love it here,
  after two months in Bali we both feel ready to move on. We could,
  however, go visit some of the other islands. One idea is to fly to
  Flores, and then work our way back to Bali by bus and ferry over the
  course of several weeks. This would allow us to see the fabled colored
  lakes of Flores, the Kimodo Dragons of, err, Komodo, and the rice
  terraces and volcanoes of Lombok. These islands are all malarial but
  it is the dry season so risk is pretty low.

<!-- -->

- Lastly, we could fly to China, and work our way down through Southeast
  Asia instead of up. China is a big place and summer is a good time of
  year to be there. After our visa in China expires we could head for
  Thailand, via Laos or Cambodia.

Anyone have any thoughts or opinions on our next move? In the meantime,
I’m heading to G-Land for 4 days to surf the wave of my dreams. I’ve
done quite a bit of research and everything seems to be fine in G-Land,
with no problems from the earthquake and no real threat from the
volcano. Julie will be hanging back in Bali for this one. As nice as a
camp in the jungle with a bunch of surfers and snakes sounds, she’s not
too keen.

It’s actually not the surfers (they’re quite nice to look at) it’s the
giant snakes with an appetite for blonds.

Nice to see what is in your head and it will be interesting to see what
comes out. So far so good. What about tea research… When I think of Asia
and snakes the image takes on a large size like Anaconda—-run screaming
from the scene….....Dun and I are off to school for four days.

Julie, Carol Lyn loved G-land, we took walks up the “wild coast’ each
day when I was surfed out and you will never see a more pristine or
rugged jungle coast. And just getting there is an adventure in itself.
The camp itself is pretty nice, run very well, and the surfers are
pretty laid back due to how surfed out everyone is during a swell. On
the other hand, it is not cheap to stay there, even if you are not
surfing.

Kai – crack it each dawn and you will get an hour or so of uncrowded
glass, then the wind will come up onshore for a couple of hours. Then
the offshores start up and everyone will be in the water – give them
some time to surf out and get hungry and then slip out for your second
session..

Larium is not a whole lot of fun – it torqued me pretty good, Carol Lyn
less. However, malaria is even less fun – once you have it, you have it
for life.

One advisory for consideration – WHO just released new info on the
Avarian bird flu. It has definitely transitioned and is now directly
human to human transferrable. Indonesia, the current epicenter, is
reporting a flu death every two days. Sumatra is getting hit hard,
Vietnam the hardest, cases now being reported in Thailand as well. So if
you head in that direction, stay out of the congested market places,
packed buses, or similar.

I know the two of you had you hearts set on travelling in that region as
it is both beautiful and inexpensive. think it through carefully,
however, as there is a very real risk that is being taken very seriously
by the health authorities.

it’s a big world, you have the time and funding, lots of places to visit
on your dream year.

love,

Dad

p.s. – kai, get a deep one at g-land for me!!

Decisions, decisions. Any consideration of visiting the Philipines? Lots
more islands. New Caledonia? Naw, I’d say continue the northward route,
you will catch the tail end of the rainy season, but you can bear it,
laughing freckles and all. Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, China, Laos and
Malaysia all await to the north. I want to go out and join up for a
month, I hope to fly out in a few weeks time, first to Vietnam, then to
other lands. Wherever you go, there you are. But keep us posted. Much
love, Trevor

As for avian flu, don’t get freaked out by the hype, it is still at a
very small scale. The great fear is its potential rather than anything
based on what has happened thus far.

Kai and Julie,  
I love your commentaries. As for avian flu, yesterday I read the latest
CDC info on Avian flu. It definitely is going human to human now. Stay
away from chickens I am also a skeptic when it comes to the big hype
about this but be careful.

I have taken Chloroquine every time that I went to Honduras with no side
effects but you need to start it 2 weeks prior to the possible exposure
and for 2 more weeks after you are out of the area for it to be
effective.

My advise is to enjoy the trip…....and have fun.

Hi guys – I agree with your Dad, Kai. You don’t have to hurry or make
rash decisions. You still have plenty of time left to go to a lot of
places. China sounds good. Malaria sounds bad. Where ever you go, get
information on what is going on in the area in regards to malaria, avian
flu, medicine availability, etc. as soon as you get there. Coming back
south through Southeast Asia after China sounds sweet. By then, you
should know a lot more about what is going with the plethora of tropical
diseases you might have to deal with when you get there. Have fun
surfing and get some photos of those giant-ass snakes. Julie, no sushi
-slutting while he’s away! Love you both – George

Hi Guys, I guess I’m not going to get to see a picture of Kai surfing on
this site. Julie, I’m sure you can figure it out!  
I hate the stuff about the Avian Flu. I know there is a lot of hype, but
I don’t trust any of our govenments or the WHO. Of course if it happens,
there is just as much chance that it will strike heaviest in SF as any
place else in the world. It could travel fast.  
I like the sound of China and visiting the tea growers. Give yourself a
couple of days of NOT thinking about anything and get your mind outside
of the box. I’m sure you’ll find your way. I love you. Dianne

G-Land = Grajagan. G-land is a very remote surf spot on the island of
Java, located on a penninsula jutting out into the East Indian Ocean,
accessible only by boat, as there is not a paved road within 40 miles of
it. A surf operation provides the boat in, three meals a day, and a hut
to sleep in. When the swells hit, the waves are as incredible as the
surroundings are.

Hello everyone,

You should know Kai left for G-Land with a huge grin and the Doxycycline
the DOH prescribed for us. Does any one know about changing medicine one
we have started? Also we were able to get a box of Coartem for an
emergency. Any suggestions?

We are aware of the human to human spread of Avian Flu and are equally
concerned. Please don’t panic we are being careful . But thanks for
helping us. It is so difficult to find consistent information on the
subject any help is appreciated.

Well hello there my nomadic cousins,

I read your recent siutation and I would vote for continuing on with
what you had planned. you can’t be afraid of what “might happen”. this
is trip is for the experience so just let it ride and see what happens.

If you guys are still travelling the globe around the end of august, I
am graduating school and would love a chance to meet up for a short
while in some far distant land. Anyway there is my two cents…I’m sure
you guys wil figure something out. Have fun!

Julie,

Regarding Avarian Flu – I recently hired a PHD for our company who is in
charge of our global Environmental Health ands Safety. The primary
reason he was selected was because of the two years of intensive
research he has perfomed in building Flu Pandemic Preparedness programs.
According to him, the CDC and WHO all agree we are pretty much in the
low risk window at the period time – they just don’t know when that will
change. so far Avarian Flu is tracking exactly like it was predicted two
years ago – primarily only contacted by those with direct and intensive
exposure to infected birds, then making the leap to human to human
exposure on a continually escalating level – end sum is an unknown. Some
infectious disease doctors believe it will end up being like the deadly
flu of the early 20th century that killed millions, others believe it
will be far less consequential – the only thing they all have in common
is none of them think it is just going to go away without some sort of
peak event.

So the thing is if you really want to travel to where it is thought to
be of some risk, just take precautions, and be ready to change plans
immediately if local conditions change.

Inodnesia is thought to be hard hit for many reasons, the most primary
the high level of tuberculosis among the polulation. Essentailly 100% of
those test in Indo prove positive for exposure to TB from some past air
borne pathogen, someones cough spray they passed thru at some time –
which is exactly how Avairan Flu will spread.

I know about the TB, as I came back from a trip to Bali 14 years ago in
which we had spent a fair amount of time, and a year later during a
routine medcial at the hospital I tested positive for TB when tested.

And you could be back in the US, step across the street, and some idiot
could run a red light and take you out – there is no such thing as a
risk free life.

so when Kai gets back from G-land, and I’d love to see the smile on his
face when he does, do some research on your destinations and what common
sense precautions you can implement, and then continue on with your
dream trip!

Really liked your blog today, and am very impressed with your photo
portfolio to date!!

love,

Dad

OH Julie B!  
Here is my take on the Malaria thing. Lauren (my friend currently living
in Zambia) was on anti-malaria drugs before she left, and then every day
that she has been there (over a year now). She got malaria. Seems to me,
that no matter how diligent you are with medication, there will always
be a new strain of the Big M around, that your meds are useless against.
As I understand it, that is the big problem with Maleria worldwide (ok,
that, and the overpopulation and the fact that any drugs, let alone
drugs that may help, are widely unavailibe in the parts of the world
that need it the most, etc etc). So, I guess my advice would be load up
on the deet and burn those citronella candles.  
They smell good anyways and won’t turn you into a psychotic (another
lovely side effect of Maleria meds.).  
Love you!

Just had to say the photo at the top of this post (Offering at Sunset)
is one of my favorites. It conveys such a sense of peace, and love for
the area, that it makes me smile and wish i could be standing there at
the edge of the world with her.

Thanks to your dad for the Avian Flu information. That’s the most
concise and informative summary i’ve read yet. I don’t know anything
about the medications, so i’ll say that i agree about the luck of life –
you prepare as much as you can for the known, cross your fingers, and
head out into the unknown.

Hi, For all you sitting on the edge of your seats, just wanted to let
you know Julie and Kai decided, and are probably on their way as you
read this, to go to Malaysia. It takes them a while to create a new
post. I’m looking forward to next update and pictures! But I’m
wondering, did you sell the surf boards? Or are you still lugging them
around? Love, Dianne

Since Kai extended his G-Land trip we havent finalised any decisions,
except that we will be leaving Bali for Kuala Limpur. And we will decide
there what to do. Kai says the surf is the best he has had, even with a
few cuts. We will probably keep one board here in Bali but who knows he
might have sold them already. He comes back tomorrow and I am eager to
see G-Land pictures and him!

This Bird flu stuff is no joke. As much as we try there is no way to
avoid birds here, as Bali is covered with free range chickens. Don’t
worry Lance, we are taking your precautions seriously.

Dear Ones,

What a wonderful position to be in. What I mean to say is that you have
infinite posibilities to chose from. The ones that you have posted and
many more. I would say spend some quiet time asking yourselves what is
that would make your hearts sing with joy to do and then don’t really
think about it or figue it out just let something arise . Then of course
it is good to consider the factors involved but I would say that as many
have mentioned that all of life is a risk so take proper precautions and
then follow your bliss. I know that you are supported in all ways and
hope to hear about the direction that you will pursue soon. Hey Kai, I
have been learning to surf on an old beater 1980’s 6’ neon green/yellow
board with some gnarly dings that have the board waterlogged. As some
little 16 yr old grom told me after I got up successfully for the first
time after about my 4th time on the water, “you are ruined man, the
addiction begins here.” He’s right. Julie I hope that you are full of
that great big smile that you carry always.

Love you guys,  
devin
