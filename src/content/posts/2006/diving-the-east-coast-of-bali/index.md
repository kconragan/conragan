Fresh from our visa renewal in Singapore, we’ve spent the past week on
the east coast of Bali in Candidasa earning our Advanced Open Water
Diver certification. In this episode we learn that Julie can write her
name backwards quicker when at 28 meters in the ocean than on the
surface.

We’ve spent our first week back in Bali in the quiet fishing village of
Candidasa. Located on Bali’s east coast, Candidasa is a marked
difference from the Bukit peninsula, with quiet seas lapping into clear
bays surrounded by terraced green mountains. All things seem to be
influenced by the quiet serenity of this area, including the internet,
which is painfully slow and why we haven’t put more posts up as of late.
We tried uploading one picture and after 30 minutes just gave up until
we could find a faster connection.

Our accommodations have been at the Pandan Restaurant, which offers
comfortable rooms for $70,000-$210,000 rupiah per day depending on
whether or not you choose a room with air-conditioning. Julie and I have
both found we much prefer a simple fan to air-conditioning as they are
quieter to sleep with and, more importantly, we find it easier to
acclimate to the heat when we aren’t constantly subjecting ourselves to
extreme temperature differences (If you spend enough time in the tropics
your body will adjust, you just have to give it the opportunity to do
so). Rates at the Pandan include a complimentary breakfast of coffee or
tea, fruit salad, and a main plate of either nasi goreng, soto ayam,
black rice pudding, or pancakes if you prefer something a bit more
western. The food at the restaurant is good but the portions are a bit
smallish and the prices are a bit higher than elsewhere with dinner
costing around $ 4 to $5 each.

As mentioned in our [Singapore
post](http://www.somedaynevercomes.com/article/3-days-in-singapore), we
returned to Candidasa with the intent of earning our [PADI Advanced Open
Water Diver](http://www.padi.com/padi/en/kd/advancedopenwater.aspx)
certification. Though I’m still a bit of the opinion that the Advanced
Open Water certification is just another way for
[PADI](http://www.padi.com) to make some money, the purpose of the
certification is to provide more focused training in select skills
necessary to become a better diver. The main reason a diver earns this
certification is so that he/she is allowed to dive deeper than 18m/60ft,
the maximum depth allowed for [PADI Open Water
Divers](http://www.padi.com/padi/en/kd/openwater.aspx). The
certification requires 5 dives, 2 that are chosen by PADI – Underwater
Navigation and Deep Diving – and 3 chosen by the diver. For our three
elective dives we chose Peak Buoyancy Performance, Wreck Diving, and
Night Diving. Our last night dive, in Monterey, hadn’t gone so well as
Julie had been entangled in fishing line and another diver had his tank
fall off of his BCD. We both wanted a second shot at a night dive, this
time hopefully with better luck. Wreck diving just seemed like a great
experience, and buoyancy control is the most important skill to master
in diving so we both wanted more focused training in that area.

The company we chose to dive with is named [Geko
Dive](http://www.gekodive.com/), a long-standing dive shop based out of
[Padangbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padangbai), which is a 30
minute drive west of Candidasa. Several divers who had been staying at
Pandan used Geko for their dives and were extremely happy with them,
especially with the lead Dive Master Sue Jarvis. Sue lives in Candidasa
so we flagged her down one morning as she was walking through Pandan and
signed up for the course. The cost is $250US, a bit expensive for our
budget but something we both agreed we wanted to do. Many dives simply
require going to greater depths than 60ft, whether to see some black
coral, visit a shipwreck, or just do a simple wall dive. As we are going
to be in Southeast Asia for some time – home to some of the best diving
in the world – we both thought it prudent to get the certification
required to visit all of the incredible dive sites we’re likely to
encounter.

We began our series of dives at Tulamben, home of the [USAT Liberty
Glo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Glo), a United States
Transport Ship torpedoed by a Japanese submarine during WWII. This wreck
is often misidentified as the U.S.S. Liberty. After being hit, the
Liberty Glo was able to make it to the beach at Tulamben, where it sat
for nearly 20 years. On March 17, 1963 [Gunung
Agung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunung_Agung) erupted, the force of
which pushed the ship off the beach where it sunk and still lies today,
making it one of the most accessible shipwrecks to dive in the world.
One only need take a few steps off the shore, plunk down in the water,
and descend 10 meters to find the wreck. Our first dive was our Peak
Buoyancy Control elective. We got to see the shipwreck on this dive but
spent a good amount of time honing in our buoyancy through a series of
tests, including a fin-pivot, which is a way of helping a diver
establish neutral buoyancy. When a diver, holding a normal breath,
neither ascends or descends while floating in the water, he is said to
be neutrally buoyant. Once a diver has established neutral buoyancy, he
can ascend a little by simply taking a breath, and descend by simply by
letting the air out of his lungs. This is called a fin-pivot, an
important skill to master as it is necessary when examining a reef
close-up.

title="Colors of the reef."><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/48t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Colors

On our second dive, which was the Wreck Dive elective, we got to
dedicate the entire dive to exploring the shipwreck. The Liberty Glo
lies parallel to the beach at Tulamben, so the deepest point of the
wreck is barely at 25 meters. Because we hadn’t done our Deep Dive
elective yet, we didn’t dive the deepest point of the wreck, but all of
the interesting points of wreck lie in less than 18 meters anyway. It’s
simply amazing how much coral and sealife has attached itself to the
wreck in the past 40 years. When you get close-up to the wreck you
almost forget you are in fact looking at a ship, as nearly ever square
inch is covered in some sort of sealife. Coming around the corner of the
deck and finding two guns, still mounted in place, quickly reminds you,
however, that you are in fact looking at a warship. The sunlight
overhead creates dramatic shadows around the outline of the ship, giving
the whole environment a very moody ambience.

The second day we completed our three remaining dives, starting with our
required Deep Dive in the morning. We performed this dive just off the
point of the bay at Padangbai. Going over our dive profile that morning,
Sue informed us we would descend to about 28 meters where we would find
some Pygmy Seahorses. We were both a bit nervous before the dive, as
obviously neither of us had been past 18 meters. Descending from the
boat we were unable to see the bottom below us, which was slightly
disorientating but it was very neat to experience being completely
weightless with nothing around us to give a fixed position. The dive
went very smooth and Sue made us feel very relaxed. Unfortunately, we
didn’t see any Pygmy Seahorses but we did see a giant Moray Eel as well
as a Stingray. When we reached our maximum depth (my computer actually
showed 31 meters), Sue had us perform a simple quiz to demonstrate the
effects of [nitrogen
narcosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis), which many
people feel when diving in deeper water. The quiz was to have each of us
write our names backwards on a tablet she had brought with her on the
dive. Amazingly, Julie was actually quicker at 28 meters than she was
back at sea level, though I’m not quite sure what to conclude from this.
My time was pretty much the same at 28 meters as it was back on shore,
so I’m happy to report neither of us are particularly sensitive to
nitrogen narcosis.

Our second dive of the day was at Blue Lagoon, just east of Padangbai, a
place we had snorkeled at several days before. Blue Lagoon was named so
because all of the coral used to have blue tips. Sadly, rising ocean
temperatures have bleached out the blue tips, but the diving is still
fantastic with a lot of coral and thousands of fish to be seen. On this
dive we practiced navigation exercises. Sue would have us swim out 30 or
40 meters from a fixed point and then try to find our way back to a
small object she had placed on the ocean floor.

not sure who wanted to eat the other more, him or me</span>

The last dive of the day and our final dive for our certification was
our Night Dive. It’s always recommended to dive a place with which you
are familiar at night, so we chose Blue Lagoon again as we had just been
there and it is an easy location with very little current. The dive
turned out to be the best dive of our certification and indeed one of
the highlights of our trip to date. Diving at night is an incredible
experience but one that is difficult to describe in words. The best that
I can say about night diving is that you truly feel as if you are in
another world. We had excellent clarity on the dive and saw a tremendous
amount of sealife including a Porcupine fish, Spanish Dancer, Boxer
Crab, Lionfish, Sunflower coral, and more. At the end of our dive during
our safety stop at 5 meters, Sue had us all turn off our flashlights and
hold on to an ascent line that had been dropped down from the boat. At
first it was pitch black, a very eery feeling. But slowly, small specks
of yellow and green light began appearing all around us, almost as if
stars were coming out. Soon we were surrounded by these small specks of
light, which are in fact bioluminescent plankton. We moved our hands and
fins and the tiny plankton swirled all around us. I had experienced
[bioluminescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence) once
before when night surfing in Panama, but there it was only on the
surface of the water. Here, it felt as if we were swimming in space,
surrounded by millions of tiny little stars close enough to reach out
and touch. We could have easily stayed the entire dive at this depth
with our flashlights turned off, but as it was it was a magical finish
to an extraordinary dive.

Porcupine fish, one of the many fish you see when night diving

That about sums up our dive experience in Candidasa and the main points
of our past week in Bali. We’re now back on the Bukit peninsula at
Bingin, which has come to feel like our home here in Bali. We brought
with us a friend we met in Candidasa, Simone, a German girl our age who
has been traveling on her own for the past four months, primarily in
Thailand and New Zealand. She had been diving in Candidasa as well (she
was on the night dive with us) but was eager to see a bit more of the
island. Our timing of arrival was excellent as a brand new swell was
just beginning to fill in as we arrived on Friday. I’m already nursing a
few minor reef cuts from my first two sessions. The swell peaked
Saturday at more than triple-overhead and it’s scheduled to hang around
for the next couple of days. On May 24 we have one more dive scheduled,
this time to go see the Manta Rays at a place called Manta Point, which
is off the island of Nusa Penida. We’ll head back over to Candidasa for
that dive. From there we are thinking about taking the ferry from
Padangbai over to Lombok. Stay tuned.

Great underwater shots, and not quite sure either what to think of
Julies reverse nitrogen narcosis functionality.. :)

Triple overhead Ulu? Can’t wait to hear about that session.

Inhale deeply, you’re living your dream..

love,

Dad

oooh.. the night dive sounds incredible. Another world would be an
appealing place to be right now. Good to hear of your extraordinary dive
adventure and right on for getting the advanced certification. Now
you’ll be ready for anything. Julie, your mom and I had a great time but
I’m sorry we missed talking with you again yesterday. ;(

Your blog is terrific and I loved seeing the fish and divers and reading
the interesting names of fish and corral and sea life. Have a great time
surfing, Kai.

Hi Guys! What beautiful pictures. Julie, I’m so proud of you. You’ve
come a long way since that day in Maui when you wouldn’t let go of Kai’s
hand. You look very adventureous in the pixs.

It seems all your dreams are coming true. I love you both.

Best diving I ever did was at night on the north shore of Oahu at Sharks
cove—the luminescent whatevertheyweres on the sea floor were like the
psychodelic posters of the Filmore and Avalon Ballrooms in SF. Back in
the old days they did not specify depths in certification that I know
of…we always went to depths though it is disconserting to have just
water above and below you and nothing on which to take a bearing—great
for the experience you both. I miss you and love you…Dunny sends slimes!
I dove with Navy hard hat divers for recreation and they would narc
after drinking the night before…careful.

Yeah, triple-overhead ulu. I’ll put it this way: I got three waves, made
all three of them, and still ended up with reef cuts :-)

Sounds like that day at G-Land – it goes from fun to damn serious
quickly at that size on a hollow reef..

Remember to scrub your cuts with fresh limes to kill any reef infection,
and hope you picked up a Gath helmet…your body can absorb more impact on
the reef then your brain!

drive for daylight,

No worries everyone, we’re safe and sound here in Bali. We didn’t even
feel the earthquake, and news travels pretty slow around here, so we
just found out about the situation last night, well after the internet
shops were closed so we couldn’t post/email until now. Anyhow, thanks
for keeping an eye out for us.
