Garnered with confidence from our warm welcome in Shanghai, we board a
train destined for Hangzhou. An old Chinese saying states, “Above there
is heaven, below there is Suzhou and Hangzhou”. *Heaven on Earth*, as it
was described to us in Shanghai. Heaven sounds nice, but we are here for
the tea.

The train drops us on the outskirts of the city. From here, Hangzhou can
be described as virtually any city in modern-day China: omnipresent haze
lingers in the air so that you’re never quite sure if it’s sunny or
cloudy. Green taxi cabs prowl the streets, their incessant horns blaring
so loud and ceaselessly that you long for silence, or at least the sound
of something more soothing—like a garbage disposal. Bikes and scooters
ride past in dizzying numbers; a cryptographer may be able to discern a
pattern from their paths; I, however, cannot, and crossing the street is
more an act of faith than one of logic.

Put a few blocks between you and the train station, however, and the
Hangzhou of legend begins to reveal itself. Green hills roll down from
the western horizon and touch the inner city limits. Where the hills end
the Willow trees begin, and they carry you all the way to the city’s
crowning jewel: West Lake. Ancient Chinese legend says that West lake is
the incarnation of [Xi Shi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Shi), one of
the [Four Beauties of ancient
China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Beauties). Adding to the
mystique are spots along the lake with epic Chinese names like *Spring
Dawn on the Su Causeway*, *Listining Orioles Singing in the Willows*, or
*Lotus in the Breeze at the Winding Courtyard*.

The lake covers an area of nearly sixty square kilometers, and almost
the entirety of its shore is lined with parks. [I said it
before](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/shanghai), and I’ll say it
again: If China has gotten one thing right, it is parks. Hangzhou is no
exception and may, in fact, be the prime example. The parks that
surround West Lake are hands down some of the most beautiful public
displays of landscaping I’ve ever seen: Weeping Willows bend gracefully
into the shallows of the lake; deciduous redwood trees provide shade for
tiny, moss-lined footpaths; green ponds overflow with red carp;
camellias, rhododendron, and azaleas; bamboo groves. Individual parks
are designed to flourish in particular seasons: Plum blossoms in
February, Cherry Blossoms in April, and so on. It’s late August, so we
are treated to the blooming of the
[Lotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus) flowers, with literally
thousands of them gracing the edges of the lake.

### Dragonwell

Adding to Hangzhou’s appeal is the fact that China’s most famous and
well-known green tea is grown here: Longjing, or Dragonwell as it’s
known to Westerners. The tea is grown just west of Hangzhou in fields
that date back before the [Tang
Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty), though then the tea
was known as Xianglin Baiyun (Fragrant Forest White Cloud). Legend says
that Dragonwell got it’s present name when workers in centuries past
pulled a large rock—shaped in the form of a dragon—from a well being
dug. Tea manuscripts from the era state that proper brewing of Longjing
tea must use water from the Dragon Well.

Dragonwell tea is revered throughout China for it’s four defining
characteristics: jade green color, sweet orchid fragrance, pure flavor,
and the flat shape of its leaves. There is a staggering variety of
grades, though accounts of exactly how many vary. It is commonly divided
into seven grades—Superior (qiqiang), Special (queshe), and then
numbered 1 down to 5. Others argue there are more than thirteen grades,
while others still say there are more than forty distinct grades.
Regardless, the highest grades are picked in early Spring. Historically,
the harvest date is three days before Pure Brightness, a term on the
[Chinese Lunisolar Calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_term).
The absolute highest quality Dragonwell tea is picked during the first
three days of the Spring harvest, and these grades are typically only
available to presidents, diplomats, high-ranking politicians, and very
wealthy businessmen (crossword puzzle fans and history buff may like to
know that Dragonwell is the tea that was presented to President Richard
Nixon on his historic visit to China).

Here’s a little secret: Dragonwell is not my favorite green tea. I’m
more partial to Bilouchun with it’s richer, nuttier flavor. And if I’m
being completely honest, I think the Japanese have refined green tea to
it’s highest form yet. Nevertheless, Dragonwell is a fine tea, and one
with much history and acclaim. One thing is for certain: sitting in the
local tea shops, drinking from a traditional gaiwan, the tea takes on
characteristics I haven’t experienced with the imported stuff I’ve had
back home. You feel like you’re drinking time, imagining poets or
emperors from days long past enjoying the same tea, likely not far from
where you’re seated now.

Hangzhou is in the middle of a heatwave, as seems to be customary on our
trip. “Wikipedia”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou says the
average temperature in Hangzhou in July is 33.8 centigrade; in late
August, it’s pushing 40. To escape the heat, we spend our first few days
visiting some of the 700 hundred teahouses in the city. It’s simply
beautiful that, in China, it’s perfectly acceptable to wile entire days
away drinking tea in local shops lost in thought and conversation. We
come nowhere near seeing all 700 of the teahouses, but our favorite is,
by far, the [Taiji Cha
teahouse](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/taiji-cha) (which we
[talked about in our previous
post](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/taiji-cha)). In addition to
the excellent Dragonwell, they serve a special tea made by their own
teahouse called Shui Dan Qing. The tea is a mix of four different tea
leaves, all small in size. To serve, it is first quickly rinsed with hot
water. Then, the next few steepings are done in cold water, which taste
especially refreshing in the summer heat. After three or four cold
steepings, the tea is served hot, like any other green tea.

### China National Tea Museum

After a few days of doing little more than drinking tea and eating, we
decide it’s time to head out for the village of Longjing to see the
famous Longjing tea fields as well as find the Dragon Well from which
the tea gets its name.

Several kilometers before you reach the village of Longjing, you pass
the Chinese National Tea Museum. Here they have a small exhibit inside a
modern building, which you walk through following a timeline that traces
the development of tea from it’s beginnings to present-day. The exhibit
is nice, but the real attraction of the museum is the grounds, which,
once again, are stunning. The museum has a healthy collection of various
tea plants, illustrating the tremendous diversity that exists within the
tea plant. All tea comes from one plant—Camellia sinensis—but the plant
has been modified to create different tea characteristics: tall and
tree-like, low and shrub-like, flat leaves, round leaves, various shades
of green, and so forth. The tea fields are open to the public (no
entrance charge), and it was the first time I got to really sit and
examine a tea leaf while it was still alive and unaltered. In addition
to the tea plants, multiple paths wind through the grounds leading you
to various gardens and different buildings used for conferences and
other “cultural” events.

### Longjing, And Search for the Dragon Well

In late afternoon we reach Longjing. It’s the time of day that makes you
thankful to be alive with late summer sunlight casting a golden glow on
the countryside. Longjing lies in Luohui Valley, and is surrounded on
three sides by steep hills lined to their very crests with rows of tea
plants. It is perhaps a falsehood to call Longjing a village; those who
live here and cultivate tea for a living seem to do quite well for
themselves, if the quality of their homes indicate anything. The ouses
line the streets, many with residents selling tea from their front
doors. Most of the houses are beautiful, multi-story affairs with large
balconies, well-kept gardens, and satellite dishes. A far cry from the
image usually conjured when you use the word *village*. In 2005,
Longjing was renovated through the West Lake Comprehensive Conservation
Engineering Project, which a plaque proclaims has helped the village
show the “richer characteristics of a tea production land”. All this
seems like a lot of bureaucratic mumbo jumbo for *Let’s make sure no
visitors have to see any squat toilets lest the name of Dragon Well be
tarnished*, but that’s just my opinion. Facade or not, the residents
here seem to be living an idyllic life.

title="Dragonwell tea fields."><img

Longjing is no secret, and the tourism board has done everything it can
to promote the village and the tea grown within. Every few hundred
meters you see wooden signs directing you to various places of interest:
the ancient eighteen imperial tea trees, the ruins of Guangfu Temple of
the Southern Song Dynasty, and so on. Regrettably, the day is getting
late, and with only an hour or so of sunlight left, we pick the
straightest path that leads to our destination: the Dragon Well.

After what feels like a long climb up a side-street, we find the park
that holds the well of legend. You have to pay ¥10 a person to enter,
but yet another gorgeous display of landscaping more than makes up for
the cost of entry. It’s early evening now, and most of the landscape has
fallen into shadows. After some wandering—all of the signs here are in
Chinese—we find the well nestled up in the back of a garden along the
base of a stone cliff. To our luck, the well is still bathed in
sunlight.

In all reality, it’s pretty anti-climatic: the well really is just a
small pond—a spring-fed well to be precise—perhaps 5 meters in diameter
at it’s widest point. The water has a subdued, jade color, and
man-placed rocks line its outer edges. Shortly after we reach the well,
a tour group of perhaps fifteen Chinese tourists—mostly all men wearing
dark slacks, tucked in polo shirts, and cell phones clipped to their
belt—arrive with a tour guide, who is saying something in
Chinese—presumably about the history of the well. For the first few
minutes, everyone pays attention. Several minutes later, most are
smoking cigarettes. Several minutes later still, only a few are
pretending to even listen; others are talking on cell phones.
Eventually, the group moves on, and Julie and I find ourselves alone.

On the backside of the well is a stone sculpture of a dragon head. I run
my hands through water; it is surprisingly cool and as the fallen leaves
swirl in the water, I look into the depths and can’t see the bottom. I
fill an empty plastic bottle I brought with water from the well,
intending to transfer some into a small vile to take home with me
later—a silly gesture, but one that seems more meaningful than the
various souvenirs available back in the city limits. The evening is
still hot, and I dip a bandana I have into the well and squeeze the
remaining water out over my head. We sit and let the evening fall,
absorbing the moment. It’s one of those places I had read about while
planning this journey and I have the feeling one gets when arriving in
place they had previously seen on postcards. The moment is ethereal. I
muse over how something as simple and innocuous as tea has brought me
half-way around the world to find myself sitting on the edge of a well.
I think back to the countless artists and poets who have been drawn to
Hangzhou throughout time—those who sat before this very well seeking
refuge, refreshment, inspiration, or, perhaps, all three—and realize
that I am no different.

As you’ll notice, we’ve started adding photos from our trip to Flickr.
We’ve had a lot of requests for more photos, so hopefully this will help
us share more with you. We’ll be putting up a post shortly detailing
more of these changes but, for now, just enjoy the photos and don’t
forget to come back and comment. :-)

The grounds and landscape sound so beautiful. Your telling of the “tea
story” is insightful and gives us Lipton drinkers a great look at what
real tea and all that goes with it is all about. Have you seen the
Camellia sinensis in flower? I was wondering how it looked. A photo
would be nice. Have been missing you mucho but now I’m off with Gato to
Monterey, so….see ya !

Julie – I always enjoy the photos, they add so much to the ongoing story
line. And I am starting to get the sense the two of you really, really
like your tea..

Love the look of those tea fields, so lush. Wonder if I could get some
to grow at this altitude – maybe to replace the Service Berry plants we
had planted on our parcel, which are currently sans leaves as apparently
the local deer consider them quite the apertif’

Miss seeing you two on our weekly video chats, hopefully we can hook up
again soon.

love,

Dad

Haha, Jason, point taken. I believe the matter is up for debate though…

I’ll admit—I just had some amazing Bilouchun in Chengdu and may be
leaning back towards the Chinese green teas. Perhaps the Japanese Sencha
I’ve had in the past has just been fresher to any Chinese counterparts.

At the end of the day, I’m in China mostly for the Pu-erh, and I think
we can both agree that they Chinese have that one dialed.

Found your site through a search for dragonwell tea. Beautiful picture
of the lotus leaves and their reflection. What kind of camera do you
use? Really enjoyed reading your description of your travels as well!
