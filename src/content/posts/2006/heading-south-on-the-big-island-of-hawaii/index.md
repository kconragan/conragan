# Heading South on the Big Island of Hawai'i

Our past day trips have lead us north of Volcano, including several
trips to Pahoa and the surrounding area, as well as a couple trips north
of Hilo to Honoli’i and Onomea Bay. Yet today, as we descended onto
Highway 11 from our house in Volcano National Park, on a whim we decided
to head South.

As they say, when it rains, it pours. And it has rained in nearly
biblical proprtions in Hawai’i the past few days. Typically, afternoon
rain showers are a welcome treat in the tropics; they are a cool and
cleansing respite from the afternoon heat and bring a sweetness to the
air. But I’m not talking afternoon spritzes. I’m talking torrential
downpours, flash flood warnings, and heavy thunderstorms.

In fact, Hawai’i has been receiving record rainfall. Kaua’i took the
brunt of the storms with several dams in the North breaking resulting in
a few tragic deaths from mudslides. But all of the islands have received
record amounts of rain. Today brought a break in the weather, and with
more rain forecast starting tomorrow, Julie and I were eager to get out
and enjoy the day.

Our past day trips have lead us north of Volcano, including several
trips to Pahoa and the surrounding area, as well as a couple trips north
of Hilo to Honoli’i and Onomea Bay. Yet today, as we descended onto
Highway 11 from our house in Volcano National Park, on a whim we decided
to head South.

<a href="/images/9.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="A tropical path to the beach"><img

tropical path to the beach</span>

We drove for 15 miles through lush green fields, Kau trees, and the
occassional Macadamia tree grove. The backside of Mauna Loa ascended
sharply to our right, covered at it’s peak with a light dusting of snow
from the day’s previous rain. To our left, the terrain descended
gradually for several hundred meters before it reached the ocean.
Several miles further up the road we saw a sign for Punalu’u, so we
turned off the highway and drove past the outskirts of yet another golf
course before reaching a parking lot filled with tour buses and rental
cars. Unsurprisingly, Punalu’u Black Sand Beach Park is a pretty popular
tourist stop as it’s one of the few easily accessible beaches on this
side of the island that actually has sand. A good amount of the
shoreline is still covered in hardened lava, beautiful to look at but
miserable to lie on.

A hundred meters off the beach a shallow reef caused little waves to cap
and then subside into the calmer waters inside. This created an ideal
little cove for snorkelling so Julie and I decided to grab our gear.
Most of the tourists seemed content to snap photos of themselves and
then reboard their tour bus without even dipping their feet in water .
As such, though the beach was crowded, there were only a handful of
people in the water.

<a href="/images/12.jpg" class="thickbox" title="A sleepy turtle"><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/12t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">A
sleepy turtle</span>

We gingerly made our way out. Even though the beach is sand, it becomes
rock again pretty quickly and our feet haven’t toughened up quite yet
from years of urban tenderizing. We kicked out a few yards and the water
quickly changed from sandy and sediment ridden to clear and blue. As my
eyes adjusted I realized I was staring face to face with a sea turtle,
no more than 5 feet away, and less than 15 meters from the shore. I took
a breath and dove down, equalizing my ears as I reached the bottom. I
turned and faced back towards the surface and watched as the turtle
glided gracefully above me, completely unconcerened with my presence. I
kicked along slowly, following the turtle. Out of the blue depths ahead,
a second turtle materialized. The turtles met up and then drifted out of
sight. Julie and I continued kicking towads the outer reef. We noted
several old boat anchors rusting on the ocean floor, quite a few
angelfish, some Parrot fish, a Bottlenose fish, and an eel.

Back on Highway 11 we moved on further South. The landscape was green
and verdent. Small pastures lie just off the road with cows and horses
grazing lazily in the midday sun. This part of the island felt strangely
familiar to us, like the rolling hills of Bolinas or Bodega Bay back
home in California. We passed through several small towns, their streets
lined with red plumeria trees and hand-painted signs advertising small
art studios and fresh smoothies. We spotted a sign saying “South Point –
12 miles”, so we turned left off the highway onto a small country road.
The road winded down the countryside, eventually becoming 1 lane. We
passed some old farm houses and a collection of wind turbines, a few of
them turning slowly in the breeze.

We reached the end of the road and pulled into a lava rock parking area
along with several other cars. This truly was the end of the road. The
small point we were on was surrounded by the Pacific Ocean on three
sides, and the the lava rocks we were parked on extended perhaps 10 more
meters before plummetting 40 feet down into the sea. We felt like were
standing on the edge of the world. In some sense we were. This spot is
southern-most piece of land you can stand on in the United States.

<a href="/images/8.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Kai admires the view"><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/8t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Kai

As we got out of the car we saw a handful of people standing around what
appeared to be a hole in the lava rock. A shirtless man holding a beer,
who clearly had spent many years in sun, bellowed at us “*Well, you flew
all the way out here, and then made the drive all the way out here. Are
you going to jump? You can pick the pool or the cliffs*”. We approached
to see what he was talking about. As we neared the hole we realized it
descended perhaps 25 feet straight down and that the ocean was clearly
visible at the bottom of it, forming a “pool”. My hearbeat picked up a
little. A tan girl in her mid-twenties stood at the edge of a rock
jutting out over the pool, and on the next surge of water, jumped.
Everyone standing around the hole hooted in enthusiasm. We walked over
to the edge of the cliff and saw the girl appear out from under the
cliff and make her way towards a rusted ladder that extended all the way
down to the water. Apparently the pool opens underneath the lava,
forming a cave that allows you to swim out to the open ocean and climb
back up the ladder. I looked a little further out and saw a free-diver,
speargun in hand, take a deep breath before diving down.

Julie and I walked further up the cliffs a ways. We came upon 3
Hawaiians who were fishing. They had garbage bags attached to a second
piece of line off their rods that would catch the wind and pull their
hooks further out than they could cast, thus getting closer to the big
fish that swam in the depths. One of the fisherman had a huge bend in
his rod, and we watched as he struggled with whatever was attached to
the other side of his line. After 10 minutes or so we saw a flash of
silver in the water below. Another fisherman, with a large hook attached
to the end of a 10 foot piece of bamboo, gaffed the fish and brought it
up the cliff. It was a Barracuda, perhaps 30 lbs in weight.

I’d had enough standing around. I walked over to the cliff area that had
an old wood structure jutting a few feet out over the cliff and took off
my shirt, hat and sunglasses. The salty local who had initially greeted
us, now on another beer, told me the cliff was 36 feet high. How he knew
this exact measurement I had no idea. The cliff was higher than the pool
the girl had jumped in earlier, but I liked jumping out into open as
opposed to a closed in space. I took a few deep breaths to calm myself
and jumped. It was a long enough of a drop that I had time to think,
“*Was this a good idea?*”. I hit the water abrubtly, but managed to keep
pretty straight so as to minimize the impact. I descended 10 feet down
and kicked slowly back to the surface. The cliffs from the bottom were
truly spectacular. The water was crystal clear and beautiful as it
surged up and down around me. I swam under the cliff overhang and back
into the pool the girl had jumped into. I looked up and saw the the top
of the hole that a few minutes ago I had been looking down from. The
whole ambiance had a feel of
[*Goonies*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/). I swam back up out
from the overhang and towards the ladder. I took a hold of it and
hoisted myself up, with the latter swaying to and fro as I made my way
up. When I reached the top I took one last jump and then Julie and I got
back in the car and headed back out the road.

Restaurant in the USA</span>

On the way home, we stopped in Naahelu for a late lunch. The restaurant
we chose proudly proclaimed to be the “Southernmost Restaurant in the
USA”. Inside, the restaurant was like an old diner from the 50’s, with
teal chairs and a checkerboard floor. Paper cranes hung from the ceiling
and Elvis music played in the background. I had stirfry and Julie had
the Korean beef plate lunch. We both had Liliko’i lemonade and smiled
about the day. As we got in the car and pointed it North, raindrops
started falling on the windshield.

Somewhere there is a blowhole that you can jump “with” but the whole
concept terrifies me. I am glad you wrote it ‘after’ the adventure
because then I know you survived.  
Having Jesse (Roy’s brother) and Gloria to dinner on Sunday and using my
new BBQ which someday you will get. It will go with the gas tank you
left for me to use. There is snow on the mountains all around the lake.
One day is fine but weeks on end and the end of March and they say we
are having global warming! Global freezing more like it.  
Read the story about the Blue Wind restaurant and the adjoining Tallman
hotel. As soon as I can get them scanned I will email.

Looks like Kai is going to wear out his trunks.  
What are you wearing?

Hi, Julie did you consider jumping? I don’t think I would have been able
to not give it a try, even if I regretted jumping on the way down. I’m
glad you’re finding adventures, even now in the safe haven of good old
USA. I love the picure of the turtle. It’s so wonderful to check on your
trip each day and share some of the adventure. Miss you guys a bunch.
Love Mom

Oh! I want adventure too! I want to jump off cliffs and see turtles and
run around in bathing suits and eat stirfry!  
I will have to settle for living vicariously.  
It has rained here seriously, for 27 days in the past month. NO JOKE!  
I miss you guys! I can’t wait til Bali…  
Now, back to work (bleh!).  
bisous!

So where pictures of da kine surf, Braddah?

Good luck on the next leg, when you arrive in Bali suggest you by-pass
Kuta and head north to Begins, about an hour and a half away – some nice
cabinas there that are inexpensive, and the wave out front is killer.

Great blogsite, look forward to the word and photo chronicles of your
travels, and hopefully we’ll hook up in a couple of months so we can
share some surfs and grins together.

Enjoy each day and every moment!!!

love,

Dad

Julie and Kai,

You’ve seen some things on the Big Island I haven’t seen. Thanks for the
tips. You didn’t mention the Green Sand Beach. Did you go there or see
it on a prior trip? How was Dogpatch?

Your trip narrative is very polished and interesting. I can’t wait for
the next episode. You beat the Sopranos hands down, no contest.

All the best,

Jack
