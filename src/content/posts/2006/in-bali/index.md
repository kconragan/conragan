# In Bali

We made it to Bali! The trip was admittedly exhausting, leaving Hawaii
at 3am on Monday and not arriving in Bali until 2pm on Wednesday. But we
are truly stoked to be here. I have dreamt of coming to Bali since I was
12 years old, staring at the perfect waves pictured each month in my
surf magazines. But once you get here you realize there is so much more,
the magic of the island surrounds you from all sides.

<a href="/images/16.jpg" class="thickbox"

The trip got off to a shaky start when we landed in Honolulu. First,
China Airlines tried to charge us $300 for the surfboards ($96 per
board + tax). After negotiating down to a still outrageous $192, the
floor supervisor then informed us that Julie would not be allowed to
bring her bag with her on carry-on as it exceeded the maximum weight of
7 kilos. I found this amusing because the whole time she was scolding
Julie, I was standing next to her with a bag that certainly weighed more
than Julie’s. Amusement aside, it was disappointing to say the least as
we were going to be traveling for over 2 days, including a 12 hour
layover in Tapei, and Julie wanted to have with her some bare
necessities like her toothbrush and a change of underwear. (\*\* It
should be noted as well that Julie specifically bought the bag as it
fell *under* all carry-on luggage requirements.).

<a href="/images/13.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="A view on the way to Bali"><img

With the Honolulu debacle behind us, we had a relatively easy 8 hour
flight to Tokyo. After a 2 hour layover we were off for Taipei, which
turned out to be a pleasant surprise. As mentioned, we had a 12 hour
layover, all of which we had anticipated spending in the airport. After
we had gotten through customs, the two of us were wandering around the
airport trying to find a quiet area where we could push two couches
together and try and catch a few hours of sleep. We must have looked
particularly lost because a woman approached us and said, *“Are you Ms.
Julie Brookman and Mr. Kai Conragan?”*. Looking at each other a bit
confused, we said yes. Well, it turns out that China Airlines had
neglected to tell us in Honolulu that they would be putting us up for
the night during our layover in Taipei. This poor woman had been
searching the airport for us after she couldn’t find us at the gate.
Well, a bed and a hot shower sounded much better than an uncomfortable
couch, so we eagerly follower her. She took us on a shuttle about 20
minutes away from the airport to the Miramar Lin Kou Golf Country Club,
which is also owned by China Airlines. Apparently this is a fairly
upscale golf course as there were pictures signed by golf stars such as
Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus.

<a href="/images/15.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="This beats the floor in the airport"><img

After a restful night’s sleep, we got up, had a complimentary
continental breakfast, and took the 6:30am shuttle back to the airport.
It’s unfortunate we couldn’t spend a bit more time checking out
Tawaiian, but the layover turned out much better than it could have
been.

The final leg of our trip from Taipei to Denpasar went pretty quick. Our
plane had the seats with the LCD monitor in the back of the headrest and
allowed you to choose your own movie. I watched Syriana and the final
movie in the Matrix series, and before I knew it we were landing in
Denpasar.

Going through customs took over an hour as there were a staggering
amount of people trying to get through. Julie and I were a bit nervous
because technically you are supposed to show your return flight out of
the country to the Custom’s Agent, and since we purchased a one-way
flight we didn’t have one. Our nervousness was unwarranted though as
when we got to the counter the Agent barely gave us a second glance and
quickly stamped our passports with a 30-day visa.

Once we stepped outside of the airport we were greeted by two things:
Heat you could cut with a knife and an onslaught of people trying to
sell you taxi services, tourist packages, and accommodations. Since
Julie and I didn’t have any accommodations to speak of, we simply let
the first person to reach us take us to the hotel he was representing.
After a bit of bargaining we settled on a nice little room at the Hotel
Pendawa for $25 per day including breakfast. The hotel, which is owned
by 5 Balinese brothers, is in the middle of Kuta beach. It has beautiful
grounds, including ornate stone carvings, a great pool, and a very
friendly staff. The rate is a bit expensive by Bali standards, but after
2 days of traveling we were happy to just get a comfortable room.

**The following is told by Julie for reasons that should soon become
apparent…**

<a href="/images/14.jpg" class="thickbox" title="Kuta"><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/14t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Kuta</span>

After getting settled we went for a walk through the shopping district
of Kuta, where you can get everything from Starbucks coffee to custom
hand made clothing. Kuta caters to Westerners and as you walk down the
street everyone asks if you need “transport” or shopping or whatever
they happen to be selling. It gets a bit old but everyone’s got to make
a living. We found a quiet place to have dinner and sat down. Kai
ordered Nasi Goreng (fried rice) and I ordered Chicken Curry. After
dinner we talked with our waiter, who’s name was “Frankie”, had a few
beers, and then headed back for bed as we were both exhausted.

Unfortunately, at about 3am Kai woke up and started puking, and
continued to do so until 2pm the next day. I tried every thing I could
think of to help him but finally I headed out to find a pharmacy. I
wandered with no success until one of the “transport” men pointed me to
a doctor. I walked down a tiny alley to an equally tiny medical clinic.
The doctor on hand wanted me to bring Kai in but I knew that it would be
impossible to carry him and he was so weak and dehydrated he could
barely make it to the bathroom and he definitely would not make the walk
in the blazing sun. After some persuasion he agreed to give me some
anti-vomiting medicine, and I hurried back to give it to Kai. Another
travel tip: Carry anti-vomiting medicine. When you need it you wont be
able to make it to a pharmacy.

We’re happy to report everything is fine now. After the food poisoning
and 2 days of traveling we are just going to take it easy for the next
day or so. Once we get our feet under us we’ll be heading to the Bukit
Peninsula for the word-famous surf. From there, we intend to go to Ubud
to get a taste of the more cultural side of Bali.

Hi kids! Happy to hear you made it. Hope Kai is feeling better. Can’t
wait to hear about and see pics from this stage of your adventure. Di
sends her love and she will write tomorrow. As a southerner, I could
have told you to stay away from fried food. I love you – GV

Hi, I’m so sorry to hear that Kai was sick. Thank you, Julie for being
so brave to go out a look for a doctor at night in a strange place. Kai,
you need to kick back and eat some extra ice cream or something to add a
little extra body weight.

What great luck to have a room to sleep in for your 12 hour layover. I
love you both. I’m excited to hear about where you’ll find to settle in
for a couple of weeks. We’ll be looking forward to the picures and next
adventure.  
Love, Mom

Ah Ubud…...! Spent some time there several years ago. One of my most
treasured travel memories. I was in awe at all the art and the beautiful
people.

Try and get your hands on some Lomotil. It will cure almost any type of
food poisoning or gastro problem. I never travel anywhere without it.

Travel safe.

Step away from the fried foods….

Good on ya Julie for getting Kai some help – takes a lot fo sack to run
around Kuta side alleys by yourself.

Once you get a few days of ducking into some tropical barrels,Kai, being
sick will have just been a bump in the road, and you’ll starting walking
around with that satisfied, semi-goofy grin on your face, like you had
in Fiji..

Look forward to the update after your first week around Ulu, according
to the long range outlook on Stormsurf, you might soon be into da kine..

be safe, immerse yourself into the moments….

love,

Dad

I was so relieved to hear you’d arrived I wasn’t aware anyone got sick
until George called me this am (Saturday). I was in SF at Pier 48
watching the 100th anniversary expo of fire(men)engines some with horses
and others with just red and gold and fireboats shooting their water
canons. Caught a glimpse of the SBC park too!

What are the people wearing in that heat. We are still dripping and cool
but there have been hints of warmth to come. Tomorrow is Easter. Stay
safe and if you have no medicine—tea and bananas are good and palatable
for upset. Potassium is helpful for the dehydration anyway. I love you.
More photos and don’t forget to take some of eachother.

Kai if you get even skinnier, I’ll hurt you before the malnutrition
does.

And Julie, I cannot agree more how brave you were to wander out by your
lonesome to find help! ;b

Hey Julie and Kai! All these “challenges” along the road of your
journeys will make all the sweet moments stand out. Besides when it is
over it makes for good stories. Kai isn’t that nice how now days we pay
extra to get bad service (surfboards) and everyone expects us to love it
and thank them for it. I am glad to hear that the boards came in
unskathed.

I know that Life will continually reveal what it is that is highest and
best for you both on this adventure.

You all have the best photos everything is like a postcard. I know you
both have loads of experience… but still.

One of my dear friends is going to be in bali for about 3 weeks for some
“spiritual” gathering. Maybe you will her pass on the street.

Love and Blessings,

Nurse Julie,

Well done. Be careful with the next “taste of the more cultural side…”

Oh Bunnybear! You are so brave. The adventures of Julie and Kai. Kai,
glad you are better—better stock up on the anti-pukey meds before
exploring the “more cultural side of Bali.” That is my travel tip…  
I am again, living quite vicariously through you two!  
Love you!

Lomotil is the ticket. Find some Cipro if you can. it’s a lifesaver.  
Love the comments and the pictures. Take care.
