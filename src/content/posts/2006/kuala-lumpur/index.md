There are few things more disorientating than stepping out of the
airport in a foreign country at 1am without a clue as to where you are
going or how you are going to get there. It is with this feeling that we
arrived in Kuala Lumpur.

What is it with taxi cab drivers? They ought to all just be called the
maitre’d – majordomo perhaps? – for undoubtedly they will be the first
to greet you as you take your first steps in a foreign country. They are
like bees, and you are a beautiful (read: rich) and exotic (read: white)
new flower in their wilted garden. We quickly pushed through the wall of
cab drivers and boarded the air-conditioned bus waiting on the street
beyond. A kind traveler we met on our flight from Denspasar had
purchased bus tickets for us on the Air Asia flight and explained that
we would need them to get downtown, which is a good 45 minute drive from
the airport. We would have gladly purchased the tickets ourselves, but
we had no money on us as the custom’s official at the Denpasar airport
had charged us for overstaying our visa by a few hours. We protested but
knew it was useless. We could pay now or spend the next 12 hours
explaining the situation to someone else before paying more. Our last
sight of Bali was that custom’s official smiling chummily as he stuffed
our last $300,000 rupiah into the pockets of his blue uniform. Bintangs
were on him that night.

The bus ride to the downtown station felt long, no doubt because we both
were exhausted and kept drifting in and out of sleep giving time that
suspended ephemeral quality.

When we pulled into KL Centre, we grabbed our bags from the storage bay
on the side of the bus, thanked the fellow traveler who had purchased
the tickets for us, and started walking. We had no idea which direction
to head so we just aimed for the brightest collection of lights, hoping
we would find a a cheap room with a decent bed for the night. The first
hotel we looked at rented rooms by the hour. In the lobby was a
toothless transvestite and several middle-aged Indian men bartering for
her company. We looked at each other and headed for the door, feeling
nostalgic for our comfortable little bungalow back in Bali. We pulled
out our [guide to Southeast
Asia](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=somedayneverc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1843534371%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1150616846%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8)
( *thanks George!* ) and located a couple hostels in Chinatown that
seemed reasonable. We flagged down a taxi and gave him the address. When
the cab driver dropped us off he insisted we pay double – *after
midnight rates* he claimed – and when I protested he spontaneously
forgot how to speak english. *English not clear. No understand. You pay,
you pay*. We gave him $2/ringit more than we had originally agreed upon
and headed for the hostel. *Traveler’s note: ALWAYS USE A METERED CAB
UNLESS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER OPTION*.

The rooms were reasonably clean and there was a secured gate at the
street level along with a a night watchman so we decided to call it a
night. I found a couple bed bugs while Julie was in the bathroom and
killed them quickly before she saw them. ( *\*\*\*Note from Julie:
Thankfully, he didn’t tell me of this until the next morning, no doubt
because he knew I would never sleep due to restless hypochondria* ).

It’s amazing how a little bit of daylight can transform a place. The
next morning (actually, just a few hours later), we got up, headed out
to look for some food, and found a wonderful breakfast down the street
of roti canai, coffee, and ginger tea. The city suddenly seemed a lot
more friendly.

We checked out of our room in Chinatown and hailed another cab for the
Golden Triangle district of Kuala Lumpur. We had read about a hostel in
that area that was brand new and claimed to have free wireless internet
available for it’s guests. We found the Trekker’s Lodge nestled into a
quiet alley just off a main street. While their wireless internet wasn’t
currently working, the rooms were spotlessly clean. The man at the
counter informed us of a special they have: if you book for 3 nights you
get the 4th night free. We chose a double room which costs $85/ringit
per night, which averaged to about $15/US per night with the special. A
bit more expensive than you average accommodation in Bali, but much
better priced than Singapore (and a lot nicer too).

We’re still getting to know the city as, admittedly, we spent the first
few days that we were here taking advantage of the free wireless
internet at Starbucks so we could perform some [much needed updates to
the
website](http://www.somedaynevercomes.com/article/something-seems-different-did-you-lose-weight).
As such, we haven’t seen a lot yet, but here are some first impressions.

### First Impressions of Kuala Lumpur

In many ways Kuala Lumpur feels like a less-well executed version of
Singapore and yet, ironically, this is what gives the city its charm.
Kuala Lumpur is a classic city in that you take the good with the bad.
It is miserably hot and yet many shops that line the streets spray mist
into the air (the same spray nozzles as you would see in a grocery store
vegetable section) making walking quite comfortable. The public
transportation system is not nearly as efficient as Singapore, but in
it’s inefficiency you are forced to ask more questions and thus you
interact more with the people. One day we met a man who dropped
everything he was doing to walk us to his favorite Chinese restaurant so
we could try some of their ginger-steamed fish.

And while we’re on the subject: the excellence of food here cannot be
overstated. Kuala Lumpur is a melting pot in the truest sense of the
term – Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, European, and, of course, Malays –
and with that comes a quality and variety of food that simply must be
experienced to believe. There are 2-kilometer long streets, lined from
end to end with food stalls, each serving a particular specialty from a
particular region in a particular country. The Chinese food is
remarkable and, for the courageous, you can try things like shark-fin
soup, bird’s nests, and frog porridge. The Indian food, with a myriad of
curries from which to try, is simply outstanding as well.

Very exciting landing! The food looks and sound great. I’m wondering
about the big retailers like Starbucks. Are they able to maintain their
specifc menus in these far cities? It’s what we love and hate about
them. We’re all waiting on the edge of our seats for the next
destination. Love, Dianne

Starbucks is pretty much the same here with a bit more limited menu (no
Chai lattes for Kai to drink). They have funny pastries with mayo
smeared all over, often with hot dogs inside. As they like to say in
Bali: *Same, same, but different…*

Oh my dears! Love the new layout BTW. Sounds like the adventure
continues, I am especially fond of the transvestite story, oh, and the
bedbugs. Good thinking Kai, I hope that the same would be done for me.
And knowing Julie, you both would have been back in the street,
seriously considering giving the transvestite another visit…  
Miss you tons. JB, google chat me…lots to tell ya about :)  
Have fun. Be safe—OMG, I sound like my mother. And I will add a “be
good” to that, as mom always says.
