# Kuching

## Sunday June 25, 2006

Usually if you say the word *Borneo* to someone they imagine rainforest.
Then they think of things that live in rainforests like monkeys or big
snakes. Cannibals even. What they don’t think of is a charming city with
white buildings and green parks built along a slow, winding river.
That’s because they’ve never heard of Kuching. Of course, neither had we
before we got here.

Our plane was an hour late taking off for Kuching, not entirely
unexpected when your final destination is Borneo. The 1 1/2 hour flight
passed relatively quickly, barring about 10 minutes of some nasty
turbulence, the kind that makes an agnostic start swaying his position
on the matter, but I digress.

Upon arrival we walked over to the taxi stand at the airport and paid
the flat rate of $17.50/ringit for a cab ride to downtown Kuching. We’d
heard before arriving that the streets in Kuching can be pretty
confusing, namely because they seem to think that street signs are
optional and thus, no one has any idea what the name of any street is.
We gave the cab driver the address to the hostel we had booked through
[Bootsnall](http://bootsnall.com), upon which seeing he got a confused
look on his face. *Greenhill?*, he said. *Yes, Greenhill*, I said back.
*Greenhill?*, he said again. *Yes, Greenhill*, I replied again. This
went on for a few minutes before he got out of the cab and ran over to
some fellow cab drivers for advice. They considered the matter for a few
minutes before the cab driver ran back over and jumped in. *Greenhill*,
he said, and started up the cab. 20 minutes later he was on the phone
saying *Greenhill* again. Another 20 minutes later we somehow made it to
our hostel, the Borneo Bed and Breakfast located at No. 3 Greenhill
Road.

Granted a rating of excellence for cleanliness by the
[WHO](http://www.who.int/) (at least, that’s what all the brochures
say), [Kuching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuching) is the capital of
Sarawak, which is a semi-autonomous state on the island of Borneo.
Sarawak, along with Sabah, the other Eastern Malaysian state, has it’s
own immigration controls, so upon arrival Julie and I had to fill out
yet another arrival/departure card and we received another stamp in our
passport. Now we have two arrival/departure cards for Malaysia, as well
as two Malaysian stamps in our passport, each with a different date
telling us when it is we are supposed to leave. When we asked the
immigration officer about this, she just shrugged. I get the feeling
things are pretty loose on the visa front here, no doubt partly due to
the fact that Thailand is a simple bus ride away once you’re back on the
peninsula. It doesn’t really matter as either way we have at least 90
days before the issue comes up, at which point I expect we’ll be well on
to our next location.

We’ve spent the past day and half walking through the city and getting
our bearings. Kuching really is a cool city; it has this sort of alive
yet laid-back vibe to it. There are lot’s of shops on the streets
ranging from Chinese medicine to plastic housewares to Sarawak arts and
crafts. The cheap and excellent food continues here as well. They have
an excellent local dish called *Laksa*, which is an extremely rich soup
with rice vermicili, chicken, prawns, and beansprouts in a spicy coconut
gravy base. They also have a local dish called *Kilo Mee* which is just
egg noodles served with BBQ pork—simple but again excellent.

Since we arrived in time for the weekend, we got to go to the Sunday
market, which actually starts on Saturday afternoon and goes all the way
into lunchtime on Sunday. This market is huge, literally spanning more
than 5 city blocks just east of the riverfront. You can buy everything
here. Dried fish. Fresh fish. Chickens and their feet (thankfully, all
have been killed beforehand). Fruits and vegetables, many of which we
have never heard of let alone seen. And that’s just the food portion of
the market. You can also buy Makita tools, or a machete if that’s more
your thing. Plants and flowers, especially an abundance of different
orchids. Pet fish. Pet dogs. Pet cats…

Speaking of cats…

Kuching literally translates into “cat”, specifically, “domestic cat”.
The problem is, the Malay spelling for cat nowadays is “kucing”, causing
some rise for dispute. Some people believe Kuching actually originated
from the Indian name for “port”, which is Cochin. Either way, the city
of Kuching has latched onto the whole cat thing and made the city
officially known as the “City of Cats”. It’s supposed to be some sort of
tourist draw, and they’ve taken this to quite an extreme. There are cat
sculptures at intersections and little cat engravings on the sidewalk
drains. Yes folks, Kuching even can proudly claim to have the largest
(presumably because it’s the only) museum dedicated to cats. The Cat
Museum as it’s called, and it’s located at the center of City Hall. Here
I must admit that Julie and I actually boarded a bus, walked up a
tremendously steep hill, and got caught in a torrential rainstorm to see
this museum. All we can say is that it is 30 minutes of our life that
we’ll never get back, but it was worth the price of admission – free –
and, besides, we can always look back and laugh. The museum may have
more appeal to anyone who obsessively collects cat figurines or posters
of cats dressed in doll clothes. Or anyone who has an interest in the
history of cats used as sex symbols in advertising – but if you do I
would strongly consider getting some help. Seriously.

Tomorrow we board we a bus and then face a boat ride up-river to visit
[Bako National Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bako_National_Park),
the oldest national park in Sarawak being established in 1957. We’ve
booked two nights of accomodations with the national park so we can
spend a few days getting a proper introduction to the rainforest.
There’s supposed to be a good amount of wildlife to see, including the
rare proboscis monkey, as well as a ton of flora and fauna. Internet
access is next to nil so we won’t be able to report until we return to
Kuching.

Some of the most beautiful okra I have ever seen. All the market photos
are incredible. I can’t wait to hear about the rain forests. That does
look like an oversized Dulce. I hope Marty isn’t overfeeding her. Later

This has to be one of my favorite posts because: a) there is giant
okra, b) I am oddly, morbidly interested in the picture of chicken feet
(those must’ve been some big ass chickens!), and c) there is a giant
Dulce. And I am quite impressed w/ Julie’s tan.  
love ya :)

I will be sure to cross Kuching off my list of Top 10 places to visit….I
am scared of cats, although,I do like the sound of KU-CHING.

Fabulous writing.

Katie:

Sadly, my tan has faded. I’ll be sure to work on that and, in the
meantime, send you some pictures when it was at it’s full glory.

Weird Aunt Linda:

If you ask me, the whole cat thing is a hoax. Someone high-up in the
Department of Tourism thought Westerners would fly half-way around the
world to visit a city of cats. Personally, I think they should have gone
with the rainforest and cannibal thing for tourist draw, but hey…

George:

You better be storing (stockpiling) some pickles for our return.

Reasons why I love this post:  
1. That Katie also noticed Julie’s tan. Julie, I soon will be as tan as
you (well, that is the goal at least). I will send pictures. We will
compare and contrast. We will see who will be victorious.  
2. The kitties. Though, a whole museum…I prolly would have gone too.  
3. Dulce kitty.  
4. Julie’s tan.  
Love you guys! I will be a few thousand miles closer to you come Monday!

Okra? Must be some Georgian thang…I too liked the chicken feet but
prefer them ON chickens. I am amazed seeing Julie in a skirt. How
polite. I thought Ku-ching was what a cash register sounded like. Don’t
those canibals live in the rain forest. What about the tea exploits? My
tan is farmer..i.e.shoulder down, neck up. Dulce is jealous that you are
playing with a bigger cat. It is not that she is overfed. It is that she
is underexercised. Though she knocks off just about everything that
moves. Tile floors break everything…alas. Miss you.

Wow, what a good comment about Kuching in this blog. I really proud to
be Sarawakian. :) Anyway, I just came across your blog and I was amazed
with your posting regarding Kuching. Thanks for the good Compliments. :)
Anyway, there is a spelling mistake regarding the famous noodle in
Kuching which it is called “Kolo Mee” and is not “Kilo Mee”. ehehe
Anyway, if anyone happen to visit Kuching, don’t forget to try the
famous “Kolo Mee” in the city which is just a walking distance from the
Main Post Office of Kuching to the street called “Carpenter Street”. The
shop is just situated at one of the corner of the junction where you can
see lots of people standing there to wait for empty seats to order the
food. :) Anyway, thanks for the great post!
