Things have been moving so quickly for us since we got back in Bali that
we haven’t had a lot of time to post all that we’ve been doing. Rather
than try and catch up with a bunch of posts, we’re just going to list
the highlights from the past 10 days or so.

### Candidasa

Our time in Candidasa (pronounced Chandidasa) on the east coast was
incredible. We met a great group of people, including Simone, who we
shared some great diving experiences with:. She has since headed back to
Thailand and then home to Germany, but getting to know her was really
wonderful. ( *Bye Simone, we’ll see you in Germany someday* ). Most
mornings in Candidasa we joined a group of friends for breakfast.
Besides Simone they included: Brian a Scotish man now living in Germany,
Jan a Danish writer who lives full-time in Bali, as well as Made and
Norret, two Balinese drivers. We sat and talked about everything from
politics to Balinese dream interpretation and more times than not
breakfast would turn into lunch.

We went on several outings to places Brian knew from his many trips to
bali. Brian has been coming to Bali for many years and at one time was
even a contributing author for [Lonely Planet](http://lonelyplanet.com),
writing the East Bali section in their [guidebook to Bali and
Lombok](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=somedayneverc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F1740596811%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1150455633%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8).
Locations he took us included Amed – a great snorkeling beach on the
Northeast coast – as well as a hidden beach known by the locals as White
Sand, which we accessed from his boat anchored in Candidasa. East Bali
is perhaps the most isolated area on the island, primarily due to the
volcanic eruption the 60’s which blocked off road access in both
directions for many years. Even today East Bali feels very remote
compared to other parts of the island, and is still many years behind in
terms of conveniences like grocery stores, ATM’s, internet access, etc.
We would not have discovered as much of East Bali without Brian’s help,
so here we must say thanks.

### The Birthday of the Uluwatu Temple

<a href="/images/64.jpg" class="thickbox"

We had a quick stay back at Bingin to attend the ceremony for the
birthday of Uluwatu Temple, which was constructed in the 11th century by
a high Hindu priest from East Java named Dang Hyang Dwijendra. At least
one person from every family in Bali attends this ceremony, a testament
to the importance of Uluwatu for the Balinese. Kai and I were dressed in
full ceremonial outfits and given the opportunity to attend the ceremony
with our Balinese family.

### Manta Point

Penida.</span>

After the Uluwatu celebration we headed back to Candidasa to make one
more dive with Simmone before she headed home. We chose to dive at Manta
Point because every diver we met said it was a must see, and the thought
of seeing giant rays sounded pretty cool. Manta Point is located in the
west side of Nusa Penida, an island about an hour by boat off Bali.
Driving around the island by boat we were amazed at the steep, dramatic
limestone cliffs that plummeted into the sea. There were literally
hundreds of caves in the face of these cliffs, and one could not help
imagine a small fortune enclosed in a treasure chest resting just inside
one of the dark holes. As soon as we arrived at the dive spot we were
greeted by a Manta Ray breaching the surface of the water, seemingly
inviting us to come swim with him. Quickly we raced to put on our gear
and get in the water. Manta Point is what is called a cleaning station,
a place where Mantas come to calm waters to have fish and other sealife
clean them by eating all the algae and other attachments they have
picked up swimming in deeper water. The rays literall hover around a
large rock and hundreds of fish swarm around them looking for snack.
There were a large number of divers at the site, but we did see many
rays, including a baby one, and it was certainly a magical experience.

Since it was so crowded at manta point we made our second dive off the
other side of the island at a place that isn’t often dove due to strong
current. It was relatively calm on this day, so we our Dive Master Sue
gave us the go ahead. This was my first experience diving with a current
– a drift dive as it is called – but it was a pleasant one and the color
of the coral was almost psychedelic.

### The Road Back to Bingin

Now we have returned from Ubud after a relaxing few days drawing and
working on the website. We had a bit of an adventure returning from
Ubud, when we were pulled over by four police officers. Having done
nothing wrong, the officer insisted that we pay or he would give make us
go to court in Bangli. Fortunately we had hidden most of our money so it
appeared that we only had rp 100,000 ($10/US) and he accepted this bribe
instead of the taking us to court (as they nearly always do). I suppose
this is part of traveling but it was a bit scary and very upsetting
because we had no power in the situation. We had done nothing wrong
except for being white in Bali and all we could do was pay. I am
certainly not a big fan of the current direction of American politics
and government but I do appreciate the concept of civil liberties and
the fact that the majority of police officers do not abuse their power
like they do here in Indonesia. What happened to us was a small ordinary
thing around here, practically like tying a shoelace, it happens all the
time, and it is accepted as a part of normal life.

Hi Julie, It’s nice to hear about Bali through your eyes. I would love
to be diving with you and Kai. You didn’t mention if you were using
tanks for not. I hope you’re enjoying some down time while Kai is off
surfing. It great to hear about you and Kai just sitting and talking the
morning through the afternoon with new friends. Love, Dianne

Julie – Thanks for the itinerary. I have already changed the maps on the
fridge. Love the photos and blog. It was nice to get a picture of the
two of you together. Love – GV

Everything sounds so wonderful. Wish I could be of more help re: the
malaria stuff. I say go w/ option \#1 from the last post, but if you do
decide to go into wetter places, just be as precautious as you can,
cover up, and try not to worry about it – don’t want worrying to keep
you from fully enjoying. I have no doubt you will pick the best route
and do the right thing, and it sounds like you’re already prepared. And
you can always swing back and visit places in their dry seasons later in
the trip. Julie, whatever happened to the mosquito net hat you were
going to get?! ;) If you did get one, I NEED a picture!  
So nice to see such happy smiling faces on you two.  
Love ya.

Can it be possible I have missed a post. I will go back and read. Really
nice to see a picture of you two together. Keep hiding your money. Did
you get pictures of yourselves in the ceremonial clothes?  
I love you…

Is South Korea on your itinerary? I watched a food show last night where
they were sampling the highlights of Korean food – live octopus (out of
the tank, chopped up, served with chili sauce, tentacles still moving
and sticking to their throats), chicken feet, entrails, and chicken ass
(literally translated as “chicken house of poo”). Not kidding. The
kimchi looked pretty good, if you can stomach oysters that have been
fermenting for a few months. Bon Appetit!
