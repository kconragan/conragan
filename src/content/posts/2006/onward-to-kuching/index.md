# Onward to Kuching

## Friday June 23, 2006

Just a quick update to let everyone know our next move. We’ve worked our
way through the highlights of Kuala Lumpur and are moving on to Kuching
in Malaysian Borneo.

Reported to be one of the quaintest cities in Southeast Asia from other
traveler’s and guidebooks alike, Kuching should be a nice change from
the [sleepless nights of Kuala
Lumpur](http://www.somedaynevercomes.com/article/sleepless). Kuching is
also well-situated for some jungle walks through one of the oldest
rainforests in the world, exploring deep limestone caves, as well as a
visit to see an authentic [Borneo
Longhouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longhouse#Borneo_Longhouse).

We purchased our tickets from [Air Asia](http://airasia.com) for the 1
1/2 hour flight from Kuala Lumpur, and are scheduled to land Friday
afternoon. We’ll post more once we’ve gotten situated.

And one last thing…

because apparently everyone forgot this momentious occasion in the
ongoing history of this planet (even her mother), today is Julie’s
half-birthday. So, umm, Happy Half-Birthday to Julie, let’s hear it
everyone ( *Note from Kai: this last part was painful just to type, so I
do apologize but Julie made me do it. OK, carry on* ).

I for one wish you a happy half birthday. Keep exploring! I loved the
shots in the fish market. It looks unlikely that I will get out to join
up with your travels. I keep telling myself someday. Oh, digging through
the music library, came across Creedence Clearwater Revival’s song
“someday never comes”. Do you know it?

Happy unBirthday! I have never understood why you get a half birthday.
My birthday is way worse than yours Julie! Kai, I loved your writing and
perspective through the gin and tonics. I’m told part of the wonder of
traveling is that sometimes it makes you appreciate home. Kuching sounds
exciting and I’m looking forward to pictures of the jungles. Love you.

Yeah, JUNGLES! Now were talking. Can’t wait to hear about it and see all
those palm trees. Glad you are getting out of the big city. Enjoy your
travels. Happy half-birthday, Jules. Love – GV

100 days on the road – keep this up, and you’ll qualify for quasi-aussie
status…

Happy Birthday Jules, hopefully you celebrated with one of those exotic
drinks with the umbrella and fruit – if not, make sure kai gets you one
at the next beach, toes frimly planted in white sand, kaleidascope
sunset on display.

safe travels,

Dad

Kai, that was the best sleeplessness story I ever read. If I ever can’t
sleep, I’m going to read it and have a gin & tonic.

Happy 1/2 birthday to Julie, maybe you should start celebrating 1/3
birthdays. The more celebrating in the world, the better.

Love,

Mom

It is my personal philosphy that everyone who has a birthday within 2
weeks of Christmas should get a half-birthday. Actually, more
accurately, if anyone wants a half-birthday, they should have one. As
Carolina said, *the more celebrating in this world, the better*. Good
call.
