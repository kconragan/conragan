Diagnosis for our dead Powerbook indeed shows both a dead charger as
well as a bad PMU. We were unable to find a store in Singapore that had
a new PMU in stock so, after some deliberation, we went ahead and
purchased a new Macbook.

It was tough giving up the old Powerbook. More accurately, it was
painful shelling over $1400 for the new computer. But we were tired of
putting money into a dead horse, and the headache involved in getting
the computer fixed—plus the likelihood that something else would break
further down the road—just made it seem like buying a new computer was
the logical answer. Our budget is busted, but man this thing is nice.

We opted for the white 2.0ghz model, and the computer company we bought
it from went ahead and threw in 1gb RAM free of charge. We also upgraded
to an 80gb hard drive to help store the photos from our trip. I would
have preferred the black model, but it was $200 more for essentially the
same computer. Black is nice, but not that nice.

Build quality is excellent. The high density plastic the Macbook is made
of is actually stronger than the aluminum of the pro versions, which is
good since we still have some hard months of travel ahead of us. The
computer is noticeably faster that our previous one, but that really
shouldn’t be a surprise as, in computer terms, our last one was
literally an antique.

Our main concern was running Adobe Photoshop, as there are no native
builds for the new Intel chips yet. I’m happy to say, while the
performance is noticeably slower than native apps, Photoshop still runs
better than it did on our previous computer.

As an added bonus, the new computer comes with an Airport Extreme card.
Using it on the street here in Singapore, we now pick up a good 15-20
wireless networks in most places, most of them completely unprotected
with a password, meaning free internet for us. Wahoo!

Hi, So glad to hear about the new computer. Looking forward to hearing
about the diving soon. But I do agree with Kaie’s last entry. Hope you
are taking enough down time and not working too much on the computer. I
know how they can suck you in 24/7. You should post the original and
offical recipe of a Singapore Sling and we’ll drink to your new
computer’s health and long life. Love, Dianne

Don’t worry were not spending too much time on the computer. We have
been enjoying downloading 24 from iTunes and working on pictures and
posts. Hopefully everyone is still wanting to know about our adventure.
(we love to see comments on our posts!)

Here is the original recipe, better consumed at home as it costs 19
singapore dollars almost 12 us dollars a piece. Hardly a bargain but
tasty nevertheless.

This is taken off the card given to us at the Raffles Hotel, which is
where the drink was invented.
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Sling "visit site")
has a recipe in ounces for non metric users

**Singapore Sling**

- 30 ml Gin
- 15 ml Cherry Brandy
- 120 ml Plineapple Juice
- 15 ml Lime Juice
- 7.5 ml Contreau
- 7.5 ml Dom Benedictine
- 10 ml Grenadine
- Dash of Angostura Bitters
- Garnish with a slice of pineapple and a cherry

Historically this drink was for ladies, but Kai enjoyed it just as much
as I did.

Cheers!

I know spending so much money on one thing, when you still have to make
it half way around the world back home, is daunting and frustrating. But
don’t ya just love the new mac?!? I love my new iMac!!! It’s just so
pretty ;-) More pictures please! And I think Katie and I need to try out
that drink in your honor…
