# Semporna Revisited

## Sunday December 10, 2006

Semporna: Philippine children—homeless refugees—begging for food;
too-loud karaoke machines; stray dogs in the streets, not all of them
living; a fish-odored wet market; muslim women with heads hidden in
scarves; monitor lizards lurking in the pond-cum-trash-dump out back the
main street; and, of course, world class diving.

After nearly eight months of continuous travel both Kai and I felt it
was time to take a break from constantly moving to new places and settle
in one place for a while. Particularly, I wanted to find somewhere I
could focus on diving and enroll in the [<span class="caps">PADI</span>
Divemaster](http://www.padi.com/english/common/courses/pro/divemaster.asp)
course, something I had talked about doing since before leaving on this
trip. Our dream was to find a nice bungalow along a quiet beach with
world-class diving close by, high-speed wireless internet available,
cheap massages, great food, and all for little money.
[Bali](/category/Indonesia/) was close to this—it lacked the high speed
internet—but it is currently the rainy season. We gave
[Thailand](/category/Thailand/) an honest look, but were too turned off
by the rampant tourism resulting in over-pushy touts and jacked up
prices. We considered the Philippines, but didn’t feel like dealing with
the hassle of extending visas. Alas, we found ourselves considering
Semporna, a place we had [visited in
July](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/diving-at-pulau-sipadan) and
remarked on leaving then what a shame it was that the town wasn’t nicer,
otherwise it would be the perfect place spend a few months. But having
searched fruitlessly, the appeal of Semporna began revealing itself.

First, Semporna is on the island of Borneo, the side owned by Malaysia.
This means that, as Americans, we get a free three month visa on
arrival, which can be renewed or extended quite easily (not that we plan
on being here for a full three months.). Second, there is relatively
high-speed wireless internet freely available, provided by Scuba Junkie,
the dive shop we dove with last time we were here and who we’ll be doing
the Divemaster course through this time around. Third, prices are cheap,
extremely cheap, though more on that later. There are really only two
downsides to Semporna: the town is about as appealing as a planter wart
and the food is about as tasty.

To be fair, Semporna isn’t all that bad, it’s just that it’s not all
that good either. As alluded to earlier, it has a few problems, none the
least of which are begging children who make you feel like scum for
coming to a third-world town only to spend your greenbacks on
self-indulgent endeavors like diving rather than putting your money
towards ending starvation or saving the rainforests. One day of diving
here costs 300RM, which is roughly the average monthly wage here. The
dogs are particularly rampant and particularly mangy. The monitor
lizards—well, the monitor lizards can actually be quite comical.

In all actuality, there isn’t much to Semporna. A few main streets with
the usual Asian shops selling miscellaneous gadgets, cell phones,
clothes, hardware, and restaurants with all more or less the same menu:
fried rice, fried noodles, curry, etc. Besides the main street, there is
one largish outside market selling various fruits and vegetables, as
well as a wet-portion that regrettably sells blue-spotted stingrays and
blacktip sharks along with the usual cod-like fish. There’s one mosque
in town, lest we forget that Malaysia is a decidedly Muslim country.

### Divemaster Course

The one and only reason we are back in Semporna is because of the
diving. To put it simply: One bad day of diving here is better than all
the diving I have done in Bali, Thailand, Hawaii, and California.

[Pulau Sipadan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipadan) is the most
noteworthy and well known, offering some of the most dramatic and
awe-inspiring diving in the world. Sipadan is a volcanic island in the
middle of the [Celebes sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebes_sea).
It’s top is the only part of the volcano sticking out of the ocean.
Indeed, you can walk the entirety of the island in less than fifteen
minutes. Step off it’s shores however, kick out a few meters and look
down, and you’ll realize the walls of the volcano drop six hundred
meters straight down below you. Currents push in from all sides of
Sipadan bringing in plankton, which act as the the fertilizer for an
overwhelming diversity of sealife, going all the way up the food chain:
hard and soft corals; nudibranchs; crabs and shrimp; reef fish of every
variety; tornadoes of thousands of barracuda; large schools of bumphead
parrotfish; trevally and tuna; blacktip and whitetip sharks; grey reef
sharks; leopard sharks; hammerheads lurking at 40 meters and deeper;
whale sharks in January and February. Did I mention Sipadan is a turtle
nesting ground? Green and Hawksbill turtles come here in thousands to
lay eggs. On our first dive back in Sipadan, the Divemaster, Sarah,
promised the entire dive group a round of beers if we didn’t see at
least twenty turtles on each dive. There’s little reason to wonder why
Sipadan makes it on nearly every top-ten-places-to-dive-in-the-world
list.

As if Sipadan weren’t enough, there are other islands slightly less
dramatic in topography but equally fascinating in sealife: Mabul, where
the term “muck” diving was invented by [Jacques
Cousteau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Yves_Cousteau;) Sibuan,
where you can find dozens of nudibranchs and almost always spot rare
frogfish; Kapalai where small sunken boats have created an artificial
reef teaming with weird things like crocodile fish and scorpion fish;
Mantabuan with it’s black coral. The list goes on but the point is
simple: the diving at Sipadan is as good as it gets…

...which is exactly what I wanted in choosing a place to do my
Divemaster course. If I’m going to bother, why bother with anything but
the best?

Choosing a dive shop was easy; I went straight back to [Scuba
Junkie](http://scuba-junkie.com). We talked about Scuba Junkie before,
but to reiterate the main points, Scuba Junkie is the only
[<span class="caps">PADI</span> licensed and insured dive
operator](http://padi.com) in Semporna. The company was started by Ric,
who is from Scotland, and Tino, who is from Germany. Both Ric and Tino
are <span class="caps">PADI</span> certified instructors and extremely
experienced divers—Tino has more than 3,500 logged dives here
alone—despite the fact that they are both only in their 20s. In addition
to Ric and Tino, there are several other instructors, all of whom we
will be learning under, as well as a handful of Divemasters and other
Divemaster students such as ourselves.

The Divemaster course at Scuba Junkie is what is called an internship
program. Basically, they cut the rate of the course to 1,800RM ($500US,
compared to more than $1000US most other places) in exchange for help in
running the shop. This includes helping customers get fitted for
equipment, setting up the boats in the morning and, the best part,
guiding customers on dives once you’ve been properly trained. The beauty
of the Scuba Junkie course is that for one price, you can quite
literally dive as long and as often as you like, whereas many other
places put a time limit on the course. Most people doing the course at
Scuba Junkie take 1-3 months to complete it, racking up 200 or more
dives in the process.

Kai couldn’t stand the thought of hanging in Semporna while I did my
Divemaster course, so even though he hadn’t planned on doing it
originally, he has gone ahead and joined me in the class. Now, everyday,
we wake up together at 6AM, arrive at the dive shop by 7AM, get the
boats setup by 8AM, and then set off for one of the many islands for a
day of diving. We don’t get to guide at Sipadan yet—the shop only allows
more experienced Divemaster there due to the dangerous currents—but
we’ve been doing a lot of diving at the other islands. We’ve already
done more than twenty dives a piece and we’ve only been here for a week.
That will pretty much be our life for the next month or so.

### Our New House

Ric from Scuba Junkie helped set us up with a bit longer term housing
for our stay in Semporna. He introduced us to a lovely woman from the
Philippines named Ping Ping, who has a house within walking distance to
the dive shop. The house is beautiful with tile and hardwood floors and
grounds containing fruit trees ripe for the picking, beautiful orchids,
and any number of other tropical plants. Ping Ping is extremely sweet,
always cooking for us and sending us off each morning with fresh fruit
for the boat. She even does our laundry. We’ve got our own room in the
house—air-conditioned—and share a bathroom with one guy, an instructor
from South Africa who also works at Scuba Junkie. Oh. The price? 300RM
per month, or about $80US.

Best of all for me is the fact that I now have access to a kitchen. One
of the things I have missed most while traveling is cooking. Now I have
access to a market with all kinds of fruit and vegetables, as well as a
kitchen to play in. I’ve already made ceviche as well as some home-style
pasta. That ought to help a bit with the food situation. Since July,
Scuba Junkie has opened a restaurant with surprisingly good pizza and
they do a chicken-roast every Sunday night for those missing home.

Darlings,  
Semporna sounds like a good place to be. I’d travel the ends of the
earth for Julie’s homemade pasta… mmm. I wonder if you’re in the water
now! diving.

Hi,

I feel nothing but envy, when I find out you two back to semporna and
start diving again : )

Is it the best diving season? How about the water conditions? And.. are
you ready for the snorkel test?

I think I will travel there some time next year for rescue diver.

Nice diving!

hey buddies what else is new? how are your studies coming? Ping Ping’s
garden looks v. inviting. Now you know you could come home and see my
new garden!!!! – Julie, we are going to grow okra so where you be at
next summer?! I bet, if you’re back in the states, I could mail it to
you….

Right now we’re picking lemons and grapefruit. The best grapefruit I’ve
ever tasted… and Robert, my boss, is well and we’re having fun on the
ranch and today we’re going to Palm Springs to ride the tram and see a
little snow. Here, however, it’s sunny and crisp and warm.

MMMMMmmm I wonder what you are cooking today! I made bean chili last
night with some chipotles from the farm you like, Julie – yes I know
we’re supposed to send you mole mix…. and now we’re having that,
tortillas, and scrambled eggs with dates. I think I am gaining weight
(again). Hard not to do in the Garden of Eden. oxxoxoxoxo much love to
you both – keep us informed and updated…

The conditions have been really good. Both Kai and I have seen many new
things that we have never seen before including Mandrin Fish, Mating
Hammerhead Nudibranches, and a Devil Scorpiton Fish.

Haven’t been cooking because I can barely muster the strength to order
from the restaurant next door. But we are having fun diving and
preparing for Christmas.

Just wanted to say hi and Merry Christmas to you both! Our restaurant is
now open and I’ve been so busy I’ve missed reading your blog for a
while. The underwater pics are amazing! Oh and I got tea for the
restaurant from Chaikana and told David about your travels. He was quite
proud and impressed, though he has never (and will never it seemed) go
on a computer so I had to just tell him as much as I could remember
about your tea experiences.  
It is supposed to be freezing here tonight. Send some of your warm
weather our way.

You probably don’t remember me, I am a distant relative living in the
bay area (my grandmother and Betty Kelso are first cousins).  
Katie shared your blogsite with me and I was excited to read the
Semporna description.  
I am also a <span class="caps">PADI</span> DM and the closest I’ve been
to where you describe was in Bunaken/Manado off Sulawesi in the early
1990s. All I can say is, enjoy this time to the fullest – you are very,
very lucky!! Happy holidays

I forgot that Christmas came a day earlier for you. So here I am a day
late and a dollar short wishing you both a Merry Christmas.

We will be gathering for Christmas dinnerat Katie and John’s later

back and will stop there on the way home.

I know that I can speak for Betty and Marty and send their love. When I
see them today, I will tell them that I have done so. If they don’t
approve, I can let you know later.

Love and best wishes, Fielding

Hi Guys! This is Jodie, Regi’s daughter. I haven’t seen you guys in  
a long time, what with all the traveling and all. I stumbled upon your
site  
and thought I might strike up some conversation. I’m 20 now and have
started  
my college career and am greatly compelled to travel. Study abroad
perhaps.  
I look forward to exchanging emails with you. Good luck and happy
travels.
