# Semporna

We’ve made it to Semporna. There’s not much to Semporna, but we’ll be
basing here to dive Pulau Sipidan- reputed to be one of the top dive
destinations in the world.

To get here we caught a flight from Kuching to Kota Kinabalu, in the
state of [Sabah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabah), and then another
short flight into Tawau. From the airport in Tawau we took a bus
downtown, and then caught a taxi, which took us across town to the bus
terminal. A 9 person mini-bus, stuffed with 13 people, brought us the
rest of the way to Semporna.

Semporna is a bit grungy and tougher feeling than Kutching; multiple
times we’ve been asked for money from children with bad deformities.
It’s always hard to say no in such situations, but if you give money to
one, you end up having to give money to all of them.

Our accomodations started at the Dragon Inn, a “floating hotel” in the
harbor. The hotel is really just a bunch of interconected docks, like a
longhouse. It feels very exotic since you can actually see the water
beneath the floor boards of your room, and when you shower (and use the
toilet) the water goes straight to the ocean through the cracks. Its not
the best for the envioroment but if you can’t beat them join ‘em. We
stayed at the Dragon Inn for two nights, but today we move to the Scuba
Junkie hotel. We’ll be diving with Scuba Junkie, as such, we get a 50%
discount on rooms (RM30 per night). This will help make up for the
expense incurred from diving. The hotel is also closer to the food
stalls and the market, a big plus.

We do our first dive tomorrow, though not at
[Sipidan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sipadan). Diving at Sipidan is
controlled by permits, and we don’t get a permit to dive until this
Saturday. As such, we’re heading to one of the other islands to get our
diving started.

We should have another post up in the next day or so documenting our
time between [Bako National
Park](/article/bako-national-park-and-why-there-are-no-snakes-in-borneo)
and now. We had an amazing week which we’re eager to tell you about.

We would also love to hear any question you might have about our trip so
ask away!

So knowing you two are gear junkies, what is your report card for what
was orginally packed for the trip vs. what you are actually using –
ratings, usefullness, great finds on the road, indepensable vs. merely
useful..
