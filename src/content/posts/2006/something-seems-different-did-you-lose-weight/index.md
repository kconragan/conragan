# Something seems different. Did you lose weight?

Well, as you can see things look a bit different around here. We’ve
ditched the previous design in favor of a leaner and cleaner look. *Why
the change* you ask? The previous design was nice, and carried with it a
certain charm, but we found it was limiting our ability to make updates,
so something had to change. Welcome to Someday Never Comes v2.

We started the original design for the site during a very hectic and
stressful period in time: right before we left for this trip. In between
packing boxes and trying to convince Julie’s mom to take the cat, we
threw the first design together. As such, the design was hurried and
never fully actualized. We tried to polish it up when we got to Hawai’i,
but it just didn’t come together how we wanted- the final result felt
unpolished and a bit contrived. More importantly, after a few months of
traveling we’ve gained a much better understanding of what we want this
site to be.

We enjoy putting together our longer posts and will continue to do so.
However, we both wanted the ability to post shorter entries to the site
as well- something the previous design limited us from doing. The
previous design required images for every post due to the coding of the
templates. We originally thought this would be a way to force us into
taking more photos. However, we didn’t anticipate the time that would be
involved for each and every post, and lately we’ve felt that site is
always a week behind our actual trip. It would usually take us 4 or 5
days to put a post up from it’s inception, at which point we already had
more to say. We also don’t want every post to have to be an essay.
Occasionally we just want to say *hey, here we are* or *check out this
food we just ate* or *can anybody tell us what the hell is happening on
Lost?* (ok, don’t really tell us, we’ve still got 3 episodes to watch).

This design is the result.

On the surface this may seem like a simpler design, and in many ways it
is. Often times the simplest solution is the best. But underneath lies a
much more thought out and developed grid system which allows for much
more flexibility with content. I think once you spend some time clicking
around the website, you’ll agree. Also, the previous design was a bit
graphics heavy and, with the slow internet speeds here in Southeast
Asia, we wanted to speed up the load times.

### But wait, there’s more…

In addition to the overall look and feel, we’ve addressed a few issues
that were bugging us plus added a few new features to the site. They
include:

- You can now add comments to the Gallery section of our site. We’ve
  been wanting more direct feedback on our photographs, so this feature
  was long overdue. We’ve posted some new image as well, so [go take a
  look through the images](/gallery/) and when you are done let us know
  what you think.
- We’ve made recent posts more visible so that they don’t get lost once
  a new post has been added. Hopefully this will encourage more
  discussion within each post.
- We’ve improved the [archives](/archives/) section as well as made it
  easier to browse posts by category (such as
  [Indonesia](http://www.somedaynevercomes.com/category/Indonesia/) for
  example)
- Images within an article pop-up in a slick new fashion.
- For those who don’t know us (or perhaps forgot), we added an
  [about](/about/) section to provide a little background on who we are
  and what we are doing.

That’s about it now for. We’ll continue with our regularly scheduled
broadcast in the next post. Hope you enjoy the new design and please
feel free to let us know what you think.

I like the new site. Just last week I started getting frustrated with
the old one (it was loading really slowly). My only other wish was to
see more photos, so i’m glad to see more already! It would be nice at
some point to know which of you took which photo, but as long as you
keep track behind the scenes, that’s all that matters (unless you become
a “Photo by Julie&Kai” tagline). I love your faces in the top banner and
being able to read more about you both in your bios and the side bars.
It’s pretty amazing that you can connect to the internet at all from an
island on the other side of the world, so congrats on making/keeping
this whole site as fabulous as it is!

I never had trouble loading the old site. Different is good. Still
cannot locate where the answer to—did you lose weight?—is? Did you?
Hotter’n hell here. Off to the barn to scan your stuff…
