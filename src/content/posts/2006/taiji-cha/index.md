Previously we [linked to a NY Times article featuring a unique teahouse
in Hangzhou](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/a-prelude-to-china).
Well, after a little bit of stumbling around, we happened upon that
teahouse in an area known as History Street.

We can offer little in the way of improving upon the extremely beautiful
pictures Chang W. Lee took for the NY Times piece. However, the one
thing the images did not fully capture—or at least I didn’t grasp prior
to seeing it in person—is how much movement is involved in the tea style
practiced here. It quite literally is a form of martial arts. I tried
taking some pictures using a 2nd-sync flash, hoping to capture more of
the movement. With the Canon G6 camera I was using, I had limited
success.

Taiji Cha poses.</span>

We spent several afternoons in the tea house, and towards the end got
them to give us a few demonstrations of all the different poses
involved. The video shows more clearly just how much movement is
involved.

For the record, the name of the style used at the teahouse is *Taiji
Cha*. *Taiji* is the well-known martial arts form from China, and *cha*
simply means tea.

Enjoy…

Sooooo, how did this all come to be? Is it all for show? Or is there
some tradition/religious beliefs/story/etc that goes along with it?

oh look, just like me when I pour my tea every morning. And I thought I
was so original…

Regrettably, our Mandarin is lacking. In fact, Julie accidentally called
an old lady a fish while attempting to say good morning (haven’t got
this whole tonal language thing quite yet). As such, we more or less
spent our time in the teahouse pantomiming things like “more hot water”.
Though, all sarcasm aside, the staff at the teahouse were extremely
friendly and, though there was a difficult language barrier, they made
every attempt—including a translation tool on one of their laptops—to
communicate with us. Nevertheless, we only got a small piece of the
puzzle.

What we learned, and what seems to be echoed by the NY Times piece we
linked to is this…

In days long past, teahouses were an extremely popular affair in
Hangzhou (even today there are more than 700 of them). The teahouses
would often become very full at peak times, making it hard for the staff
to maneuver around the patrons and tables to fill tea pots with more hot
water. The long-spout teapot evolved over time to make filling teapots
from a distance possible so they didn’t have to walk through the crowd.
The design of the teapot, in a very true sense, is an example of form
following function. Over time, the teapots gained a bit of a reputation,
and the spouts were made longer and the taiji added for a bit of flair.
Eventually, it became it’s own style of serving tea, known as *Taiji
Cha*.

This is, of course, only what we gathered from the NY Times piece and
broken conversation with the Taiji Cha staff, so take it for what it’s
worth.

so what do they really put in their “tea”...no really, seriously…

Last time I saw someone moving like that was 30 years ago at the Avalon
ballroom while the Grateful Dead were playing, and I gotta think they
had been drinking their tea as well…

Longjing (known as Dragon Well), is the most popular tea in the region
as it’s grown just outside of Hangzhou. In fact, Longjing tea is the
most popular green tea in China. However, they serve all types at the
teahouse, including other green teas, oolong, black tea, and pu-erh.

They have a special tea known as Shui Dan Qing, which is a mix of four
types of green tea and brewed cold. Very tasty, though I don’t think it
will make you dance like you’re at a Dead show, which may be a very good
thing…

Hi Kai and Julie, We were all looking and listening together. At the end
of the clip, is that Julie laughing? It sounds so much like her. I miss
you both. As you know from your hard work and practice, being good
enough at anything that you’ve practiced gives you the “flow” which
moves our bodies into a dance. These people have obviously practiced and
enjoy showing their dance. Lots of fun to watch. One of the most fun
posts. Love, Dianne

Dearest Julikens and Kai,

What an interesting teastory! I never discovered anything like that when
I was in China. But I did discover congee for breakfast with all sorts
of delicacies sprinkled over—most delicious, a 1000-year old egg. Not
quite that old, of course, but having real character. The pickled
vegetables are great, too.

Julie, your mother actually telephoned me! She was in wonderful spirits,
looking forward to meeting you and Kai in Bangkok. It will be a terrific
experience for her! She sounded really happy. Says she talks to you more
often from China than when you were here.

Trevor is on a roll. Loves his new job. But dear Rags is failing—one of
the world’s truly great cats, worthy of the Cats Hall of Fame. All
Trevor and I want for Christmas is for Rags to be sitting on the steps
outside to welcome us. He knows the duties of a host and fulfills them
to perfection. But he must be 25 years old now—a prodigious age. A very
sad moment.

My dears, this will be the last you hear of me for awhile—I am off
Sunday to Croatia and then Stockholm, back at the end of the month.
Possibly I can check your blog in an internet cafe—I’ll try.

A couple of my friends have visited your site and found your accounts
most interesting and your photos beautiful. Cindy will be holding the
fort, so check in with her when you need to. Meanwhile, take care of
yourselve! Don’t forget to find The Wild Swans. If you can read only one
book on China, this is the one. Lots of love.

Your Patricia
