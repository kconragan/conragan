In an amazing display of procrastination, we’ve managed to be in Thailand for an entire month without writing a single word about it. This is due to several factors, including wanting to finish our story about [Melie Snow Mountain](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/beyond-shangri-la) before moving on to Thailand and a deep sense of apathy induced by too many Thai massages.

Thailand has been quite a change from [China](/archives/china/). Though
practically neighbors, the countries are worlds apart in culture: where
China is loud and in your face, Thailand is quiet and passive; in China
ordering a simple meal can be a test of one’s merit, whereas Thailand is
filled with english-speaking touts pushing smoothies, tailor-made suits,
tuk-tuks, and more. In all honesty, we’ve had a hard time adjusting to
Thailand. It’s a beautiful country filled with friendly people, and yet
you can’t help but feel that the onslaught of tourists has overshadowed
the Thai culture. Before coming to Thailand, a friend we met in China,
who lived in Thailand for two years working as a teacher, told us that
“Thailand isn’t real”. We thought this was a cynical way of looking at
things, but now that we’ve been here for a while, we understand his
point. Somehow, Thailand hasn’t yet felt genuine. You begin to feel like
a commodity—a dollar sign with legs—and every Thai person you meet will
invariably try to sell you a product or service. You become distrustful,
and try to avoid engaging Thai people in conversation so you don’t have
to repeatedly decline their offers. This is, of course, a gross
over-generalization, and certainly more meaningful encounters can be had
by simply leaving the heavily-touristed areas, of which there are many.
The hard part, of course, is leaving behind the umbrella drinks and thai
massages. Tired from eight months of near continual travel, we’ve barely
managed to do so.

### Bangkok

<a href="/images/245.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Julie and her Mom."><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/245t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Julie
and her Mom.</span>

We’ve also picked up a new traveling companion: Julie’s Mom, Marty, who
decided to fly out and see us. We arrived in Bangkok on a flight from
Kunming one day before the scheduled arrival of her mom from San
Francisco. We settled into the Atlanta Hotel for a night, and the next
day move to the Grande Majestic. As of recent, Marty has developed
arthritis in her hips, so she had a few requests in a hotel room:
elevator and a bathtub. We warned her that once we got out of Bangkok
these would be tall orders, but she told us she wanted to ease into
Asia. We weren’t complaining though: in addition to elevators and a
bathtub, we had a big-screen television complete with cable TV (man
watching <span class="caps">CNN</span> is an ugly experience), breakfast
buffet (french toast, on the other hand, isn’t), and room service.

Once Marty recuperated from the long flight, we set off to explore
Bangkok in the usual tourist manner. We started with the Grand Palace,
which was built in 1782 both to mark the founding of Thailand’s new
capital (Bangkok) and to house the revered Emerald Buddha, which is
still kept their today (no pictures allowed). The palace is undoubtedly
beautiful—a collection of buildings, each with a specific purpose (one
houses a piece of the breastbone of the Buddha) and ornately decorated
with cracked tile, glimmering glass, and gold-leaf. We also visited the
house of Jim Thompson—the best remaining example of traditional Thai
architecture. Jim Thompson was an American who came to Bangkok after the
second World War as the head of the OSS—a predecessor to the mondern-day
<span class="caps">CIA</span>. He is credited with having revived the
dwindling Thai silk industry, and in doing so became something a
celebrity in Thailand. When he was alive, you could address a letter to
“Jim Thompson-Bangkok”, and it would find it’s way to him. Mysteriously,
Jim Thompson disappeared on a trip south to the Cameron Highlands in
Malaysia in 1967, and has never been seen or heard from since. I find it
ironic that the best example of traditional Thai architecture is
exemplified in a house owned by an American.

<a href="/images/244.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Grand Palace, Bangkok"><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/244t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Grand
Palace, Bangkok</span>

The highlight of Bangkok for me was going to see a Muay Thai Kickboxing
fight, something I’ve long wanted to do. As luck would have it, the
night we decided to go see a fight, two champion kickboxers were
scheduled to be in the ring. I was, however, disappointed to learn that
foreigners (namely, white people) must pay three times that of locals
for the same seats even—1000 baht for the nosebleed seats, or, close to
$30US. Upon this realization, Julie and Marty decided to pass on the
fight and treat themselves to Thai massages, which average a much more
affordable 150 baht, or about $4US. Nevertheless, it was a great show,
with much bloodshed and gallantry.

Truthfully, I couldn’t get out of Bangkok fast enough. Some places you
have a strong, visceral reaction to; perhaps I was slave here in another
life, perhaps not, but every atom in my body wanted to leave Bangkok the
moment I stepped foot outside the airport.

Bangkok is a huge, sprawling city, a prime example of uncontrolled urban
expansion. It has ten million residents, half of whom own cars, creating
traffic and smog to match the western *City of Angels*: Los Angeles (it
is no coincidence that three days is my max in L.A. before needing to
leave, it is the same for me in Bangkok). Like so many Asian cities in
pursuit of modernity, gigantic steel buildings have been erected in all
parts of Bangkok, and concrete roads put in place of old canals that
once were navigated by boats.

On my arrival in Bangkok, I happened to be reading a book called
<a href="href=" http:="" data-www.amazon.com="" data-gp=""
data-redirect.html?ie="UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFortune-Teller-Told-Me-Earthbound-Travels%2Fdp%2F060980958X%2Fsr%3D11-1%2Fqid%3D1163583760&amp;tag=somedayneverc-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&quot;">hi</a><img
src="<http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=somedayneverc-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1>"
data-"="" />A Fortune-Teller Told Me: Earthbound Travels in the Far
East, a book by the journalist
<a href="http://www.tizianoterzani.com/" class="url fn">Tiziano
Terzani</a> wherein he decides to heed the advice of a fortune teller in
Hong Kong and not fly for the duration of one year. In his overland
travels through Asia, he finds himself in Bangkok, and describes it as
such:

> . ...dirty, chaotic, stinking, where the water is polluted and the air
> lead-poisoned, where one in five has no proper home, one in sixty,
> including newborns, is <span class="caps">HIV</span> positive, one
> woman in thirty works as a prostitute, and someone commits suicide
> every hour.

To me, nowhere is Bangkok better exemplified than in Khao San Rd, the
fabled street known to all backpackers as a cheap place for beer, rooms,
and sex. Khao San Road represents what I hate most about the current
travel scene: young westerners looking for a cheap place to party. The
street is lined with seedy hotels, myriad cafes, innumerable stalls
hawking knock-off clothes and cheap jewelry, tattoo parlors, girlie-boys
looking to confuse already confused men, and an overwhelming barrage of
travel agents selling the same packages:
<span class="caps">OVERLAND</span> TO
<span class="caps">CAMBODIA</span>, <span class="caps">ELEPHANT</span>
<span class="caps">TOURS</span>, <span class="caps">LAOS</span>, etc.
The irony is that few who roam Khao San Rd. will ever venture further
than Koh Pha Ngan for the next [full moon
party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon_party).

### Chiang Mai

And so we turned our attention North, first to the infinitely more
inviting Chiang Mai, once a stopping point on the old [Hippie
Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail) coming out of India in
the 1960s. Chiang Mai is Bangkok’s second largest city, yet has managed
to retain the charm that Bangkok could not. There are few—if any—tall
buildings in Chiang Mai. The city is really just a collection of
neighborhoods that have grown into each other and been connected by
roads as needed. The center of the city is still surrounded by an old
moat and old wall, though the wall was heavily damaged from bombing
during <span class="caps">WWII</span>. Inside the walls, at the heart of
the city, lies a surprisingly quiet neigborhood comprised of narrow old
streets and comfortable guesthouses to match nearly any budget. We
settled on a place called C.M. Bluehouse.

Our first full day in Chiang Mai we hire a driver to take us outside the
city to the outlying villages of Bo Sang and San Kamphaeng, famous for
producing Thai silk, paper umbrellas, and more. These villages are well
on the beaten path and extremely touristy, but it’s neat nonetheless
taking a tour of the thai silk factories, where they show you how the
silk is made, from silk worm to finished piece. Between the three of us,
we manage to purchase more than a dozen umbrellas, and several pieces of
Thai silk.

A highlight for Marty is visiting the hardware stores of Chiang Mai, and
she purchases an on-demand hot water heater to go with her collection of
umbrellas and Thai silk, which surely must be the oddest souvenir ever
purchased in Thailand.

Back at our guesthouse we meet a man named Dennis who quickly becomes
the fourth member of our traveling group. Dennis is from the Pacific
Northwest, sixty years old, and most impressively a cancer survivor of
five years. He moved to Thailand full-time a year ago, and now makes his
home in a small town further north called Pai. He’s in Chiang Mai making
purchases for the restaurant he is starting, which will be called
*American in Pai*. He’s eager for us to join him when he returns to Pai
so he can show us around.

First things first though, and namely my birthday. Even though time
slows on the road, it doesn’t stop, and we celebrate my 28th birthday
dining along the Ping River that runs along the eastern edge of the
city. Marty wants to do something nice for my birthday, so, in addition
to dinner, she treats me to a custom-tailored suit.

Tailors in Thailand are world-renowned, namely for their ability to
recreate any suit for a fraction of the cost. We go to a place
recommended by Dennis named Bruno’s, and settle in for a few hours
browsing through catalogs, looking at fabric, and getting measured (I’m
disappointed they don’t ask me which way I dress). We settle on a
three-button suit made from a very slightly brown fabric. We also
purchase some silk in the nearby market to have them make a few dress
shirts: one raw silk, one light pink, and one seafoam green. All said,
we order one suit, an extra pair of pants (pants typically wear out
before the jacket), and three silk shirts with French cuffs. The grand
total: $150US.

With the suit ordered, we join Dennis on a three hour bus ride further
north to Pai.

### Pai

Pai is that rarest of towns: a place that actually lives up to what is
promised. It’s a quaint town nestled deep into a valley in the far north
of Thailand, right near the border with Burma. As with most towns near
borders, Pai has a healthy mix of cultures, including Lisu and Lahu hill
tribes people, Muslims from Burma, Yunnanese from China, and Westerners
looking for a quiet place to escape.

Despite it’s small size, Pai is a bustling little town. The bus from
Chiang Mai drops us in the center of town, and Dennis walks us across
the street to a bright green building, which is where his pending
restaurant will open. He used to own three business in the green
building including an all [Apple](http://apple.com) internet shop, a
cafe, and movie house. He sold the internet shop and movie house and
kept the cafe, which he is now renovating into a breakfast only
restaurant. He has come to Pai to retire and slow his life down, and
wants nothing more than to cook some good old-fashioned American
breakfast for a few hours each morning, before retiring in the afternoon
to whatever catches his fancy.

Small villages lie all around Pai in the outlying hills, and the small
country roads just beg to be explored. So, we rent some scooters to do
just that. I haven’t ridden a scooter since being in
[Bali](/archives/bali/), and it feels wonderful to have transportation
again without having deal with buses and cab drivers. Marty has never
ridden a scooter before—and is convinced it’s a plan to kill her—so we
give her some practice driving the side streets of Pai before setting
off into the open country.

<a href="/images/249.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Marty in scooter training."><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/249t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Marty
in scooter training.</span>

Dennis doesn’t drive, so I take him on the back of my scooter, and Julie
and Marty follow on their respective scooters. There are many outlying
villages around Pai, and we spend several afternoons driving the small
country roads, stopping frequently to look at verdant landscapes, small
villages, and the occasional elephant.

<a href="/images/248.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Elephants on the side of the road outside of Pai."><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/248t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Elephants
on the side of the road outside of Pai.</span>

Pai has a healthy community of expats and, on our second to last night
in Pai, Dennis organizes a small party for us at a guesthouse in the
hills above Pai near his home. It’s a beautiful night, and we dine on
barbecue pork ribs and potato salad (compliments of Dennis) on a blanket
spread beneath a towering teak tree. The moon and stars are resplendent
and occasionally accented by fireworks shot off from a distant hillside
where locals are holding a cremation ceremony.

After four very peaceful days in Pai the three of us, along with Dennis
who has more errands to run for his restaurant, decide to return to
Chiang Mai. Julie is eager to get to the beach and go diving. For
myself, I’ve been away from the ocean for over two months, by far the
longest stretch of my life, and am just as eager. The journey back to
Chiang Mai is a bit more eventful than the journey to. Only twenty
kilometers outside of Pai, our van begins making a horrible noise out of
the left wheel. I’m not much of a mechanic, but I’m pretty quickly able
to tell that the van has a bad wheel bearing. We’re too far from Pai to
walk back, and the journey ahead is a steep, winding road, and none of
us want to risk it with a wheel bearing that could seize at any minute.
The driver leaves us on the side of the road and goes for help.

We spread out on the side of the road and make ourselves as comfortable
as possible in rising heat of the late morning. The van is parked on a
slight incline, and for some reason (probably too many bus rides in
China) I get the idea in my head that it might be a good idea to block
the wheels with a rock so the vehicle can’t start rolling. I approach
the vehicle to look in. As I lean in the vehicle it begins rolling. This
is a bit of a problem as our entire group is spread out in front of the
van, lying in various states of discomfort, the closest being Julie’s
Mom who is fully reclined with her head head facing the van. I quickly
turn the steering wheel and am able to direct the van off the the side
of the road before it runs anyone over (except myself, as the van rolls
over my Teva-clad foot). Unfortunately, the vehicle comes to a stop with
two wheels stuck in wet grass on a steep shoulder. Now it’s not only
broken down, but also stuck. I’m feeling pretty embarrassed by this
point, thinking I’ve done something stupid. But then I poke my head
inside the van and realize what happened: the driver had left the van in
neutral and failed to put on the parking brake. *Genius*! Feeling
fortunate no one was hurt, Marty jokes that since the scooters had
failed, this had been Plan B to kill her off, which we all got a good
laugh from.

Shortly thereafter, the driver returns and is absolutely flabbergasted
to see his van lying in a ditch. He calls his boss, who arrives thirty
minutes later fuming. He accuses all of us of tampering with the
vehicle, and actually has the temerity to say that it would have been
impossible for the vehicle to just roll of the side of the road all by
itself. I point out the simple law of physics, namely gravity, I tell
him had the vehicle started rolling and had I not been able to turn the
wheel, the van would have ended up in far worse shape as I pointed down
the road. I also tell him that had the van run over one of us, we’d be
having a very different conversation. At about this point, a local bus
pulls up and Julie, Marty, Dennis, and myself grab our bags and board
it, looking back at the boss and driver scratching their heads staring
at the van.

Back in Chiang Mai, we spend one more evening with Dennis at CM
Bluehouse, and the next day board a flight bound for Phuket and then a
two hour ferry Koh Phi Phi.

### Khaolak Scuba Adventures

In Koh Phi Phi, we have one thing in mind: diving. After hanging around
Phi Phi for a while, we decided the best diving for the money is
available on the numerous liveaboard dive boats. After walking around
and talking to all the diveshops, we settle on going with a company
called [Khaolak Scuba
Adventures](http://http://www.khaolakscubaadventures.com/). The package
is an all-inclusive 4 night/4 day trip to the Similan Islands aboard a
90 foot boat powered by twin Hino 350hp engines.

The basic itinerary is as thus: board a boat at 5pm, eat dinner, go to
bed. The next morning, wake up, realize you are now three hours from the
mainland in the Similan Islands, eat a light breakfast, go diving, come
back and eat a full breakfast, nap, go diving, eat lunch, nap again, go
diving, relax, go diving, eat dinner, go to bed. The next day, the same
thing, and the next day, so forth. In total, you get fourteen dives over
four days.

<a href="/images/250.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="14 dives = very happy!"><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/250t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">14
dives = very happy!</span>

Marty, who used to scuba dive when she lived in Hawaii in the 1970s is
amazed at how easy and catered everything is. Indeed, so are we. The
staff do everything for you, right down to putting on your fins so you
don’t have to bend over with your tank on. After every dive fresh fruit
is waiting for you, and there is an endless supply of coffee, hot
chocolate, and water. Nevertheless, Marty is content just hanging around
on the boat—though she’s convinced since Plan A and B failed, this must
be Plan C—and she spends a good deal of time on the sun deck listening
to the first three books in the Harry Potter series on our iPod.

As for the diving, it’s excellent. I had hoped to see a whale shark, but
it’s still early in the season and not quite enough plankton have
entered the waters to draw them in. Still, the diving is first-class.
The Similan Island are world-renowned dive destinations, and we have an
excellent Ship Coordinator—a passionate diver named Gerardo from Mexico.
The Similan’s consist of nine small islands, each commonly known by
their number, and Gerardo makes sure we see all of the highlights on
each. On the list of spotted creatures: multiple leopard sharks
including a pregnant female, banded sea snakes, blue razor wrasse fish,
octopus, scorpion fish, lion fish, cuddle fish, oriental sweetlips,
ghost pipefish, many-banded pipefish, and the myriad types of reef fish
that populate the waters.

Our third day is the best day of diving, as we wake in the morning to
learn the ship has been driven further north to a dive location called
Richelieu Rock, a splintered rock pinnacle in the middle of the Andaman
Sea. The dive site is shaped like a horseshoe, with one primary rock
that at low tide juts out of the water, and several smaller rocks around
it’s edges. The rocks are covered with anemones, sea fans, barrel
sponges and soft corals of all kinds. We get three dives in at Richelieu
Rock, and highlights include a bright yellow pregnant sea horse as well
as a clown frog fish.

Exhausted from fourteen dives and enough nitrogen in our bloodstream to
pressurize many kegs of beer, we return to Phuket just in time to see
Julie’s Mom off to Bangkok and for us to make a visa-run to Burma. We
now have a fresh 30-day visa in Thailand, and not a clue as to what
we’re going to do with ourselves. Julie is thinking of getting her
Divemaster certification, but other than that we have no plans. We still
plan on hitting Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos, but want to settle down for
a bit and recuperate from eight months of near continuous travel. So, if
you had a month in Thailand, what would you want to do?

coming days once we get a decent internet connection. Please check back
soon!**

Hi guys!  
OK, I am truely jealous…I have heard many stories of Thailand from
various people, and you have pretty much confirmed what I already knew—I
<span class="caps">NEED</span> TO GO!  
And I was told that I would really like the Full Moon Party…On the other
hand, I am a fan of seedy bars and and “cheap places to party.” ;)  
I also hear that Koh Phi Phi is just amazing and that the diving is
spectacular.  
Plus, now that you are a group of three, we get more pics of you two
together :)  
So, now I will be spending the rest of the day cheapticket.com-ing
flights to Thailand, and perhaps will go get some Yum Nuer for lunch
today. :)

lounge away the day… and I’d keep an eye out for Leonardo Decaprio….

Well “Throw Momma From the Train” doesn’t sound like much of an
invitation to join you two. Is that a grimace on Marty’s face? It sounds
like you are making the best of Thailand and I would suggest that you
stay close to the Ocean and away from any rolling vans. I love the
picture of you and Julie after 14 dives. I don’t think I’ve seen you
look so happy and relaxed in years. I’m jealous after seeing the
pictures of the elephants. Are they really just wandering on the side of
the road? Love, Dianne

Hello

Looks like you two have been having some fun. We just returned from
Myanmar truly quite different from anything else yet. I was just
wondering what your plans are for Christmas and where you think you will
be around then. We are leaving for Cambodia tomorrow or the next day. We
think probably Saigon for Christmas? But maybe some beachs near there or
in Cambodia.

Drop us a line.

Dear Julie & Kai,  
Your blog is sensational. You really know how to travel, write, and
capture the magic in photographs.  
You probably know all about this, but I thought of you recently. I was
reading an article in the November 18-24 issue of The Economist (maybe
you can buy it or get it online at <www.economist.com>). The article is
under “Blogging” in the Business Section, byline San Francisco: “More
people are quitting their day jobs to blog for a living.” Basically, you
could run your blog as a small business, outsourcing the promotion and
advertising sales. The split is about 60% of the revenue for you & 40%
for the company doing the administration. It might be a way to keep you
going — you live the life and others can read about it! The company they
mention is FM, run by John Battelle (formerly of Wired and Industry
Standard).

Marty should be home now! I can’t wait to hear all about the adventures
at Thanksgiving.

With love, Aunt Katie

Hi You Two! Sounds like you had a great time with Marty/Mom visiting.
Marty and I are friends and she sent me your website to take a look. So
very interesting are your travels! Enjoy!
