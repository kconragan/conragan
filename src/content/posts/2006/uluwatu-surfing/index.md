# Uluwatu Surfing

The swell had picked up overnight. It was 6am, and I was standing on a
run-down cement foundation that jutted out of the hillside, giving me
the best view of waves below. We were back on the Bukit Peninsula, after
a few days spent in Ubud, and I watched as an overhead set fired through
the reef at Bingins.

The waves short but almost mechanical in their perfection. I’d surfed
out there a couple times now and the waves were fun, indeed, they would
have been epic back home. But they weren’t what I had come for. I looked
further south and could just make out an explosion of whitewater at the
furthest point visible. I walked back up the rickety path to our
bungalow at Lynee’s, strapped my surfboard to the rack of my $4-a-day
motor scooter, and headed off. The going was slow at first. The
unseasonal rains had left the dirt roads a muddy, soupy mess.

Standing on the cliffs that overlook the mythical reef of Uluwatu, I
experienced a sense of disconnect. It wasn’t so much that I couldn’t
believe that, after years of dreaming, I was finally here. The
disconnect resulted from my mind attempting to put together two
disparate images of the scene which unfolded before me, and my presence
loomed somewhere in between. Long had I constructed a mental image of
Uluwatu – magazine articles, photos, stories told from other surfers –
had all been synthesized into an idealistic vision of a surfing mecca.
Hawaii has long been the true surfers’ mecca, the place where a surfer
must go to test himself against the power of the ocean as well as the
legacy of those who came before him. But Bali – and at the heart of the
island, Uluwatu- emerged as sort of a younger sibling to Hawaii, and
what it lacked in grit and consequence, it made up for in mysticim and
sheer perfection. It was every surfers’ dream to climb down to the
fabled cave, it’s dark walls framing the perfect waves beyond, and
paddle out into the blue horizon that awaits. Somewhere, along the
rugged cliffs and reef-hewn barrels, a surfer finds himself here. Yet
standing here now, the vision was blurred and finally replaced by what
was before me: 40 surfers lined the 150 yards of lineup, and as I stood
in the sweltering sun, two Balinese women approached me and shouted
‘t-shirts, you buy, cheap, cheap’.

*The mysticism has died, but the wave remains the same.*

A solid 6-8 foot swell was pushing through lineup. The outer reefs would
come alive with whitewater, signaling to the surfers inside that a set
was approaching. I made my way through the pack of surfers looking for,
as I always do when it’s crowded, a seam in the lineup. Gone are the
days when surfers took turns swapping waves in the lineup. There used to
be, though it can still be found in lower profile lineups or on those
rare uncrowded days, an unspoken knowing of who’s turn it is on the next
wave. Surfers would fall into a rhythmic timing, guided by the pattern
of the sets and pull of the tide. At a certain level that model can’t
work anymore: statistically, on a good day at an average surfspot, there
are more surfers in the lineup than waves. As such, surfers must
compete—through skill and often times simple physical intimidation—to
get a good set wave. While this competition can at times be healthy, it
usually results in flaired tempers and, most importantly, mistakes. My
strategy with this new lineup was to sit just inside of the main pack
and let the alpha-male surfers jockey. I knew eventualy one of them
would take off too far back, or not make the drop, and I would take the
opportunity to turn and go. My plan worked as no more than 5 minutes
later I found myself gliding into my first wave.

Mid-way through my session, as I was paddling back out from an earlier
ride, I saw a set wave swing wide in the lineup. I followed the course
of the wave, it’s height building as the reef grew shallower. The wave
had gone too far over on the reef for the surfers back at the main
take-off area. In fact, this wave looked like it was swinging too wide
even for me. I turned and took a couple hard paddles down the face. The
peak of the wave was quickly moving down the line. I angled my board
sideways as I stood up, knowing I’d never make the wave if I allowed
myself to go to the bottom. Turning sideways as the wave crested, I took
a few quick pumps down the line and then ducked under the lip as the
wave broke out in front of me. The barrel was tight at first, and I
could feel the whitewater swirling beneath my board. I hung on for a few
yards when, suddenly, the wave opened up and gave me a room with a view.
I took a couple more quick pumps, trying to get my speed up, and with a
last surge forward, emerged out of tube and drifted up and over the
shoulder. Welcome to Uluwatu.

I have never surfed before. Closest I have come to them is while diving,
being below the surfers at the bottom of the ocean and watching them
above me. Maybe you should strap on a video cam while you surf. Correct
brough-t in first sentence.

Love, M

Yeahoo! Waves at last. Good for you. Parker and I are looking at you on
that scooter, with that shit-eating grin on your face, and we still come
to one conclusion – you are a nerd! We love you – P and GV

Hi Kai, I loved your description of the the wave. You have always been
very zen about your masculinity. Parker was describing you to some of
his buds last night. He said “He’s like this 10’ gorillia stud backed in
a 5’8’ body”. Just a little guy talk I overheard. I wish your first view
had been with no one else and an empty line of perfect waves. Oh well.
Sounds like a beautiful day and a great tube. Can’t wait for the next
post.I love you. Mom

The picture of you on the motor scooter is priceless. Your trip to Bali
is bringing back wonderful memories to Dad and me.

You and Julie should go to the temple that is the belly button of the
world.

Love,

Mom

Wear your sunscreen and avoid bugs!

Hey dudes – I had a dream about surfing last night, but it was nothing
like Kai’s story, although I’m sure it was inspired by it. I was surfing
on Kai’s broken board (the blue garden decoration one), at night, at
Pleasure Point, and somehow I was really good on the halved board. And
there were lots of dolphins and hot guys. Ah, the wonderful world of
dreams. Yeah, I want to second/third/fourth the comments about Julie….
where are ya? More pics and stories! (All this pressure, and you thought
you were on vacation!) love, me

We’re loving the comments everyone, keep them up.

I promise that Julie is working on some posts. Expect some posts from
her soon, though know that all posts are read and approved by both of us
before they are posted.

It’s been hard for Julie to take pictures of me surfing as the waves are
far out and we don’t have a very long lens (not like she can tell who I
am when I’m surfing anyway after 7 years).

We’re wearing lots of sunblock, I think that has been the biggest,
unexpected expense of the trip

West Oz, hmm….

Do read your regular email. Kai, meet anyone out there on the water from
home yet? Julie, I still want to know what the women wear and what the
food in the food stalls looks like. What do they wear on their feet?,
heads? I am glad it is not just me that wants to hear from Julie.

I love you bead!, your Mother…Marty. Roy wants to know if they have
Ceviche?

Hahah, no, I regret to say I didn’t surf in that helmet though maybe I
would have gotten a few more waves if I had, simply from everyone unable
to paddle for laughing at me.
