5am wake up, sleepy drive to the Oakland airport (thanks Mom!), hugs to the family, and we’re off. Our trip is officially underway and here is the first post to prove it.

We have arrived in Hawaii and the trip is officially underway. We arrived on the Big Island of Hawai’i with pretty little headache though, as usual, my surfboards didn’t make it onto our connecting flight (from Oahu to the Big Island).

In all of my travels with surfboards—including Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, Fiji, and more—I’ve only ever had my boards show up on-time and undamaged once. Don’t forget that *ALL* airlines charge extra fees for surfboards, anywhere from a flat rate of $50 to $50 *per board*. Let me ask you something: Have you ever been charged per golf club? I didn’t think so. It’s the airlines little way of making a cheap extra buck, as they know surfer’s have no other plausible options to get their boards to their destination. Don’t forget that we get to pay for the priviledge of having our boards show up damaged (we even have to sign a waiver) or several days late. The airline industry is truly one of the worst around for customer service. And yet they wonder why they are all bankrupt.

Anyhow, enough ranting. We’re in Hawai’i and it is beautiful! After Julie and I had picked up our rental car and grabbed some lunch, the surfboards had arrived safely on the flight behind our’s and we were able to get on our way.

Before heading over to Hilo, which is on the other side of the island (if you’re wondering why we flew into Kona instead of Hilo, don’t ask), we stopped and took a quick dive in the ocean to remind ourselves that we are in fact, in Hawai’i. At the beach we went swimming at there were 4 turtles just hanging out in the sand. Nice.

I must admit that this whole experience doesn’t seem real yet. The excitement that I would have anticipated to be here hasn’t arrived yet, but I think much of that is due to the fact that we are starting in Hawaii, a place that is familiar and still very much at home for both of us. But I’m glad we decided to start here. Julie and I both felt we would need some time to unwind from the stress and demands that we’ve had of late, both getting prepared for this trip and wrapping up the engagments and commitments we needed to fulfill.

It’s simply staggering how difficult it really is to completely pull yourself out of the flow of daily life. There are obvious demands such as exiting gracefully from work and saying goodbye to the family (which can be emotionally draining). But there are so many other things, mundane and underestimated, to take care of before leaving for an extended time. Taxes, stopping all reocurring payments on credit cards, vaccinations, getting rid of personal items and putting the more valued ones in storage. The list goes on. It’s funny how travel of this nature is often seen as an escape, a way to just blow off the demands of life. I think it’s quite the opposite: *you have to work if you want to take a trip like this*. I’ll be writing some more specific posts about this issue, but for now it’s suffice to say that long-term travel is certainly no vacation.

For the now plan is simple: we are going to rest, unwind, and discover what Hilo has to offer us. Towards the end of March we’ll be meeting up with our friend Denise, who is a dive instructor and is starting a dive business on the Kona side of the island.

Glad the blog is up and running. RELAX! Have you gone surfing yet?
Remember, no sock tans! We miss you. Took mom down to Pt. Lobos over the
weekend and went for a good hike. I can’t believe you saw turtles the
first time you went in the damn water, you lucky shits. Take it as a
good omen. Love- GV

Hi! I think it’s such an adventure what you have both been through in
the last month. I think very few people could realize how difficult and
demanding it is to exit from our “normal” life style. I’m sure you miss
having a home nest, but I bet there are very few times you look back and
miss all the “stuff” you threw away or put into storage. The house seems
big without you two. I’m so happy to now be able to read about your time
in Hawaii. Still thinking about meeting up with you around April 10th.
Let me know soon about your estimated date for leaving for Bali. I was
looking at some comfortable hotels that look affordable. I’d like some
time to unwind and be on my own too. Love you both, Mom.

Finally, finally came. I am jealous that you are there playing with
Paul. He is a good guy and boy am I going to owe him bigtime. I am
getting nervous that you are now leaving so soon but I know you will
have fun and adventure. Afterall, I love to travel and they don’t call
me queen of the road for nothing. Roy and I are getting the chicken
house fixed up. He is still having a fit over having six to 24 hens and
only one rooster. He keeps talking about digging a hole just outside the
hen house to put the dead roosters in as they keel over from all that
work.

The new ponies are doing well. We are now turning them out on the grass
for an hour per day. Wally, our goat is darling. He is the best treat of
all. And I confess my favorite pony is the little stallion. I am such a
mare-liking person that I am surprised by my feelings for this little
guy…and they are all brown too! I plan to go down to Elke’s for her
birthday. She will be going overnight with her Mom. Please send me
Katie’s contact information in case I need a Julie fix. Try to get in
some slak key or at least local music before you leave.  
Maw with love
