# What Should We Call This Post?

A Kodak Moment? The Decisive Moment? Cheap Therapy? The lengths Julie
will go to get some comments on this blog? We had a hard time picking a
title for this post, so we’ll let you decide…

<a href="/images/119.jpg" class="thickbox"
title="Julie and an albino python getting to know each other."><img
src="http://somedaynevercomes.com/images/119t.jpg" /></a><span class="caption">Julie
and an albino python getting to know each other.</span>

With therapy these days costing $200-300 per hour, we decided to cut to
the chase and face Julie’s
[Ophidiophobia](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/bako-national-park-and-why-there-are-no-snakes-in-borneo#comments)
head-on: by wrapping a 7 foot long albino python around her neck all for
the sake of a photo. Enjoy.

I picture Kai and Julie hunched over the macbook reloading this page
over and over waiting to see if there are new comments…

ok, ok, so here goes…

with the line about the lengths Julie will go to to get comments for the
blog, my first thought was “Wow, Kai is even better with Photoshop than
I thought”...

Then I thought “if the old computer hadn’t died, maybe Julie could have
afforded the therapy rather than this.”

Then I thought “Holy crap, that’s a 7 foot albino python around Julie’s
neck”

and finally, all the way here in California, I heard Julie yell “Kai,
put down the camera and get this \#$%@!!! snake off of me”

Congrats to Julie for not being really, really, really brave

This is no official post! You have hurt the feelings of reptiles
throughout the globe. The next time you dive, thousands, not hundreds,
of sea turtles will attack in defense of their albino brethren. This was
a serious misnake on your part. You took the wrong serpentine path at
the forked tongue in the road. This venomous insult will have anacondian
repercussions from ophidians everywhere.

This post should be called “Albino Python’s 1/2 Birthday”. The white
albino python had fallen in love with Julie while following her
adventures on this blog. The albino python’s name is Whitey. Whitey’s
mother arranged for this photo op on Whitey’s 1/2 birthday. Julie out of
the kindness of her heart agreed to the photo; and thus, has overcome
her fear of snakes.

I like ” Whitey’s Half Birthday Surprise” idea. There are few people
special enough to have a half birthday. It is amazing what lengths Julie
will go to be in the center of attention. The big question is did the
therapy work? Are you still afraid of snakes? Love, Dianne

You know, wrapping a snake around Julie in Photoshop wouldn’t be so
hard, but creating that look on her face would be down right impossible.
That expression is, in a word, priceless.

The therapy only partially worked. From this episode we learned that,
counter-intuitively, Julie is not afraid of big snakes, rather, small
snakes. She claims she doesn’t like the way they wriggle. Of course, the
fact that this was a pet snake named “chicken-rice”, owned by a man with
six fingers only adds to the confusion.

Maybe now would be a good time to tell her our next stop along the road,
Penang, has a temple filled with pit vipers?

Since no one has taken it “there”, and it is my usual duty as a friend
to ALWAYS take it “there” (it’s actually written into my and Julie’s
Friendship Contract, Clause 16), or maybe it is the fact that Katie and
I just got back from a weekend surf/camp trip with 8, that’s right, 8
guys…but whatever the reason, I am going to call out the white elephant,
er I mean python, in the proverbial room. Your post should be titled:

“Julie and the Giant Trouser Snake.”

OH MY GOD!!! JULIE!!!!!!

Heheheh I can’t believe it! Just the other week I was reliving the story
about you grabbing me when we went on that hike because you “thought you
saw a snake.”

Well Julie, I am proud of you, I know that took some serious guts.

The look on your face is priceless!

Julie – On a serious note, I am blown away by the facts that you are
diving over 100 feet down and flirting with an albino python that is
hanging around your neck, not to mention smacking big monkeys upside the
head when they are hassling your lover boy! Impressive. Love to you both

Ewww. I don’t have anything but a healthy fear for snakes and I don’t
think you’ll ever see a picture of me holding one.

Annie just talked to John Tabata and he told her that they just named
their baby boy Kai.

wow, was that snake heavy? good for you, Julie, for inviting it around
your neck as easily as a feather boa, or a diamond necklace. Small,
harmless, little garter snakes are good luck around here – farmers love
to have them in the garden. gee, from the girl who used to tease me
about being afraid of bugs… oh, well. Aversion therapy works. ;) Are you
enjoying some delicious Malaysian food? How is the tea? Miss you miss
you miss you.

OK,OK,OK I’ll pay for the therapy. Actually, I think I need terapy now.
I am so glad that these photos of you and the writings occur AFTER you
return from some adventure or after such things and wrapping a snake
around you has occurred. (Kai, remember the conversation I had with you
before you left…it was the “bring her back alive” lecture..I am holding
you to it. I am not sure my innerds can take this stress.

Julie, remember when we would go to Sonoma to pick up firewood on our
property. And your father pulverized a 9 inch snake to the point that we
could not even find any of it for proof…when therein lies the source of
your fears. Of course, as we drove toward home—some two or more hours
later the snake grew to be about three feet long, maybe three.

I am in Oregon, delivering Carrie to the breeder. She is sold. Back home
late Sunday.

No way….no way….no way….would I EVER put a snake around my neck. Julie,
you are my new super hero, wonder woman! My vote goes to “Julie and the
Giant Trouser Snake”. I like the image it conjures up!

I think it should be called “the audition”. I didn’t know you wanted to
be in the movies!? I thought of you when i saw an ad last night about a
new movie coming out about snakes getting loose on a plane (lots of
snakes! yuck!). I have no intention of seeing it! Snakes are pretty, on
a tree, far from you and me.
