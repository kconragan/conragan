Since our indefinite stay in Semporna, we’ve fallen into a steady routine. We’re doing at least three dives daily (four if we go for a night dive). We’re constantly diving, which leaves us happily exhausted, and the blog has taken a backseat.

Our days go something like this:

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6:00 AM**  | Wake up | Still groggy |
| **7:00 AM** | Load dive boats | Gear check and prep |
| **7:30 AM** | Breakfast and tea | Earl Gray|
| **8:00 AM** | Boat departure | Greet the days customers |
| **9:30 AM** | First dive | We often aim for South Point if we can|
| **12:00 PM** | Second dive | Often a wall dive like Hanging Gardens |
| **1:30 PM** | Lunch | Fried rice and noodles. Every. Single. Day|
| **2:30 PM** | Final dive | Turtle Cave is a great end of the day |
| **5:00 PM** | Return to shop | Unload boat. Return rental gear |
| **5:30 PM** | Relaxation | De-gas nitrogen. Watch *The Simpsons* |
| **7:00 PM** | Equipment check-in | Meet next day’ divers|
| **7:30 PM** | Logbooks | Finalize logs with customers |
| **8:00 PM** | Dinner | Chicken curry and fries, or pizza |
| **9:00 PM** | Beers | Tiger or Carlsberg |
| **10:00 PM** | Bed | Zzzzzzzzzz |

Rinse and repeat…

All of this being said, we’re each averaging three hours of diving a day, submerged in the beautiful Celebes Sea, surrounded by sharks, turtles, barracuda, manta rays, nudibranchs, frogfish, and more. Most of our dives involve guiding customers, which doesn’t give us much time for photography, but we’re gaining more diving experience than we could have ever hoped for. Since there’s not much more to report, we thought it’d be fun to give everyone a description of the different islands we visit daily.

### Sibuan

Besides Sipidan, we spend more time here than any other island. Sibuan is your classic tropical island paradise with white sand, palm tree, and warm tropical water. Philippine Sea Gypsies inhabit the island, so most of the day we have little naked children running about and if you ask nice enough, they will climb the palm trees and give you coconuts. Sibuan is ideal for teaching people to dive as it has nice clear water and good patches of sand for Open Water students to practice their skills in. Since we have Open Water courses nearly everyday, we spend a good amount of time here.

*Paradise of Sibuan.*

My favorite dive off Sibuan is called Left Shoulder. It’s a shore dive, since we usually beach the boat there. I start in one meter of water, visiting a pair of porcelain crabs and some squat shrimp. Next, I visit the resident giant frogfish. She is gentle and sometimes grips my finger with her webbed foot if I offer it. If you haven’t held hands with a frogfish, it’s like having a baby wrap their hand around your finger. There is also a tan frogfish and a rust one, but they blend too well with the surrounding environment and I can’t always spot them, but Kai seems to find them almost every time. (Guess he was good at playing Where’s Waldo). We end the dive by hunting in the sand for devil scorpion fish and snake eels. Sometimes we luck out and find baby frogfish—even cuter than the adults!

There are other dive sites at Sibuan, Froggie’s Boulevard, with its beautiful hard and soft coral, and a chance to see eagle rays, ghost shrimp living on fire coral, not to mention huge cuttlefish which look like the aliens have landed. The Drop Off is where I had my deepest dive to date at 41.1 meters, and also where I saw my biggest nudibranch at 6 inches.

We usually see a Hawksbill turtle or two happily scratching their tummies on the sand or on coral at all the dive sites. At Mandarin Bay and Mandarin Point we look for Mandarin fish. They live in the black sea urchins and are quite shy which makes them hard to spot. When you find them, they look like candy, with cutely pursed lips like they are blowing you kisses.

Yes, Sibuan is paradise.

### Mabul

Mabul is my second favorite island because every time I go there I see something that I have never seen before. The visibility is usually bad—10-15 meters—but that’s ok when you are muck diving because you swim along with your nose close to the rocks, anyway. There have been a few times where I was looking at nudibranchs and almost put my hand down on a stonefish or a turtle, because I was too busy focusing on some cute little bugger. Fortunately, I always look before touching and have avoided sleeping turtles and poisonous fish (so far!). My two favorite dive sites at Mabul are Artificial Reef and Lobster Wall. The Artificial Reef has many sunken structures from 10 to 22 meters, a playground for divers. A huge school of Jackfish circles the sponge and soft coral structures, which are home to a wide variety of animals including frogfish (yes there is a theme here) scorpion fish, stonefish, lionfish, banded-pipefish, a plethora of nudibranchs and flatworms, flying gurnards, not to mention all of the common reef fish that make Mabul home. You can stay on the island with accommodation ranging from 50 RM to 1900RM for a deluxe resort. Hopefully we will stay there someday, but for now [Ping Ping’s](http://somedaynevercomes.com/article/semporna-revisited) is perfect.

### Mantabuan

Known for its black coral forest that looks like white fairy bushes, Mantabuan is one of the few small islands that doesn’t have extensive damage from past and present dynamite fishing. As such, Mantabuan has some of the most beautiful hard and soft coral in the area. Dynamite fishing was once pretty common here. Sadly, it’s still practiced by some, but the situation is improving. The difficulty is in teaching the locals about sustainable fishing practices. A fisherman can go out to sea, work all day, and maybe bring home a half-dozen to a dozen fish with traditional fishing practices and barely make enough money in the market to feed his family. Or he can go out, drop some dynamite off the side of his boat, and watch as dozens of stunned fish float up to the surface for collection. If you didn’t know better, which method would you use? It’s quite shocking to be diving and hear a dynamite explosion underwater. Since sound travels 4 times faster underwater than in air, you never know which direction the dynamite is coming from and it is very disorienting. You can literally feel your heart skip a beat. Dynamite fishing reminds us of the need to protect these beautiful reefs.

### Sipadan

We can’t rave about Sipidan enough. When the visibility is good, it simply dwarfs every other dive site we’ve been to. Imagine diving at Yosemite Valley and having all of El Capitan to explore underwater. Once you drop over the ledge, you are simply overwhelmed by the sheer size of the wall and the multitude of sea life that makes it its home. The beauty of Sipidan is that you can see everything, and plenty of it, often all at once. Other dive sites might show a few barracudas; at Sipidan, you can see a few thousand on a single dive, as well as giant schools of jackfish, bumphead parrotfish, napoleon wrasse, batfish, yellowback fusiliers, and more. Of course, you have sharks, ranging from smallish white tip reef sharks to giant hammerheads. At the right time of year it’s not uncommon to see a few Manta Rays gracefully swimming in the deep. A few weeks ago we saw six four-meter-long grey reef sharks, a leopard shark, two manta rays, and a school of barracuda—all at the same time.

On my first time guiding at a dive site called the Drop Off, we went inside Turtle Cave, a giant cave that goes straight through the island and let’s out on the other side. The cave is quite dangerous to dive in it’s entirety as it’s easy to become lost. Some of the first people to dive the cave found turtle skeletons resting on the silty bottom. The romantic version of the story says that Turtle Cave is where turtles go when it’s their time to die. The less romantic version is that turtles become lost in the cave and drown before finding their way out. On our dives, we only enter 5-10 meters into the cave, and then turn around to admire the panoramic view. Anyhow, on my first time guiding there we swam in a bit and I turned around to see a two meter whitetip shark circling around us inside the cave. It’s a strange feeling to be in an enclosed space with a shark, and I had to keep telling myself that they prefer to eat fish than divers. Needless to say we didn’t stay long, but it was a thrilling experience! Nearly everyday at Sipidan something remarkable like that happens.

:) Happy to have the update. It may be ground hog day, but the same
thing every day in a tropical wonderland can’t be too bad.

All the noodles reminds me of our college days, and way too much mi

Hi Guys, Thanks for the update Julie. I’ve missed your adventures and
your life now doesn’t sound all that boring to us folks stuck behind
desks where it’s very cold outside. I loved the picture of you and your
birthday cake. Hope to hear from you soon. I’m seriously thinking of
visiting. I emailed some dates to Kai. Let me know! Love, Dianne

Oh Julie! Wish you were here. No to rub it in or any thing, but Willie

I’ll get you a T shirt or some thing. I am stoked, Willie at the

Dear Julie and Kai,

Loved your latest entry. Kai, you’re a great writer, but since many of
my treasured letters from childhood are from Julie, it’s a thrill to
read her missives again. So… are the two of you going to be teaching
diving and surfing? I may just have to fly out for lessons.

Lots of love, xooxxoxox…. what’s new at the farm? well yesterday I
picked 600 lbs. of grapefruit. Wasn’t really that hard; we picked two
loads into the tractor bucket. It’s the best grapefruit ever… and such a
pretty yellow peel with pink blushes… xxoo The desert is beautiful!
Climbing at Joshua Tree this summer…

of. I am <span class="caps">DYING</span> here! ;)

Now I will write you a real email (I thought the public plea for contact

Hi Guys, Now would be a good time to check in. Maybe you haven’t even
heard about the earth quake, but everyone here has. Are you both OK? Are
you still in Bali? I’m imagining that you’re hanging out at Lynne’s near
Bingin Beach having a great time, not knowing we’re all worrying about
you. Has anyone out there heard from Kai and Julie?
